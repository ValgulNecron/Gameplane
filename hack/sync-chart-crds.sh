# sync-chart-crds.sh: copy the controller-gen CRDs into the Helm chart's crds/
# and crd-manifests/ directories, stamping every copy with a bundle hash.
#
# Purpose:
#   The chart's crds.autoApply hook (templates/crd-apply-hook.yaml) must fire
#   on `helm install` when the cluster already holds CRDs an earlier,
#   uninstalled release left behind (Helm's crds/ install silently skips
#   existing CRDs), but NOT on a genuinely fresh install, where crds/ has just
#   created current CRDs a moment before the hook is rendered (F-218). A plain
#   "does the CRD exist" lookup cannot tell those apart. The stamp can: the
#   hook compares the live CRD's `gameplane.local/crd-bundle-sha256`
#   annotation with the one in crd-manifests/, and only a mismatch (or a
#   missing stamp, i.e. a CRD from a release that predates it) is stale.
#
#   The hash covers every generated CRD file, so a schema change to ANY
#   Gameplane CRD changes the stamp on all of them.
#
# Usage:
#   hack/sync-chart-crds.sh     (run by `make manifests`)
#
# CI re-runs it and fails if the committed chart copies differ.
