# Feature Specification: Nuclear Option Module & Load-Balancer IP Pool Override

**Feature Branch**: `002-nuclear-option-ip-pool`

**Created**: 2026-08-16

**Status**: Draft

**Amendments**: 2026-08-16 — (1) Join-coverage language aligned with feature 001's framework (canonical status vocabulary, JoinDepth, tracked artifact); (2) unverified assumptions restructured and explicitly marked in affected requirements; blocking risk (unlicensable or no Linux build) plainly stated.

**Input**: User description: "I want a new module for nuclear option https://store.steampowered.com/app/2168680/Nuclear_Option/ and support for ip pool ovveride"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Operator deploys a playable Nuclear Option server from the catalog (Priority: P1)

An operator discovers Nuclear Option in the game catalog and wants to run a multiplayer server. They select the module, configure basic settings (server name, password, max players), and the server becomes joinable by real players within a few minutes.

**Why this priority**: This is the fundamental user journey — making a new game available. Without a deployable, joinable server, the entire feature is incomplete. This is what confirms the game is actually supported in practice, not just declared in a template.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested independently by creating a GameServer for the Nuclear Option module, waiting for it to boot, and confirming that a real game client can connect and join the match using the game's actual network protocol (not a mock handshake or bare socket dial).

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** an operator with permissions to create GameServers, **When** they select Nuclear Option from the catalog and click "Deploy", **Then** the GameServer is created with sensible defaults (server name, 8–16 player limit, 8 GB of memory, 30 GB storage for game binary and mission data).
2. **Given** a freshly created Nuclear Option GameServer, **When** the pod reports Running and the agent reports ready, **Then** the dashboard shows the server as "Accepting Players" or similar and displays its join address.
3. **Given** a running Nuclear Option server with an advertised address, **When** a real game client attempts to join using that address and the game's wire protocol, **Then** the join succeeds and the player appears on the server without errors (verified by the client receiving a successful connection message and the operator seeing the player in the player list).
4. **Given** an operator viewing the server's dashboard details, **When** they check the Remote Console section, **Then** the console is accessible and ready to receive commands once the server has finished its boot sequence.

---

### User Story 2 - Operator pins a game server's public address to a chosen load-balancer address pool (Priority: P1)

An operator running multiple clusters or a cluster with multiple address pools wants to ensure a specific server gets an address from a designated pool (e.g., "production-us-east" or "testing-tier"). They set this preference in the server's networking settings and the server is assigned an address from that pool instead of the default.

**Why this priority**: This is the core IP pool override feature. Without this, operators cannot control which pool a server's address comes from, making it impossible to meet network topology or compliance requirements. It enables predictable network segregation for multi-cluster deployments.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested independently by creating a GameServer with a specific pool preference set, observing that the assigned public address falls within the requested pool's address range, and confirming that changing the pool preference (before or after initial assignment) either reassigns to a different pool or clearly explains why reassignment cannot occur.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a cluster with multiple configured load-balancer address pools (e.g., "pool-us-east", "pool-us-west", "pool-testing"), **When** an operator creates a GameServer and sets the pool preference to "pool-us-east", **Then** the server is assigned an address from the "pool-us-east" range.
2. **Given** a running server assigned to "pool-us-east", **When** the operator changes the pool preference to "pool-us-west", **Then** either (a) the server is reassigned an address from "pool-us-west" (with a brief service interruption) or (b) the dashboard clearly explains why the change cannot be applied without a restart.
3. **Given** a server with no pool preference set, **When** the server is created and deployed, **Then** it receives an address from the cluster's default pool (the behavior unchanged from today).
4. **Given** an operator creating a server via the REST API (not the dashboard), **When** they specify a pool preference in the GameServer's networking config, **Then** the same pool-assignment logic applies and the server is assigned accordingly.

---

### User Story 3 - Operator administers a running Nuclear Option match remotely (Priority: P2)

An operator needs to moderate a live match: see who is online, remove a disruptive player, manage bans, broadcast a message, or adjust the next mission rotation. They use the Remote Console in the dashboard to run these commands and see real-time feedback without restarting the server.

**Why this priority**: Remote administration is essential for operators running live matches. Without this, responding to player grievances or chat spam requires either restarting the server or logging in directly, both disruptive. This is a standard expectation in server hosting products.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested independently by connecting a real player to a Nuclear Option server, then running each moderation command (get-player-list, kick, ban, broadcast, mission-set) from the Remote Console and confirming the command executes and the result is visible both in the console output and on the server side (e.g., the player disconnects when kicked, the next mission changes, the message appears in game).

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a running Nuclear Option server with at least one connected player, **When** an operator opens the Remote Console and runs the "get-player-list" command, **Then** the console returns a list of connected players with their Steam ID, display name, and faction.
2. **Given** the same server and player, **When** the operator runs "kick-player" with that player's Steam ID, **Then** the player is disconnected from the server and the console confirms the kick command was accepted.
3. **Given** a server with an empty ban list, **When** the operator runs "banlist-add" with a Steam ID, **Then** that Steam ID is added to the ban list and the console confirms the operation; a subsequent join attempt by that player fails with a "banned" message.
4. **Given** a live match, **When** the operator runs "send-chat-message" with text, **Then** the message appears in the in-game chat and all connected players see it.
5. **Given** the current mission near completion, **When** the operator runs "set-next-mission" with a valid mission name from the rotation list, **Then** the console confirms the change and the server advances to that mission when the current one ends.

---

### User Story 4 - Operator requests one specific fixed address for a server so a published DNS record stays stable (Priority: P2)

An operator publishes a server address in a community listing or configures a stable DNS name for their game server. They need the same public address across restarts. Instead of using a pool name (which may assign a different address each time), they can request one specific address and the system assigns it to them durably.

**Why this priority**: This supports a common operational need (community rosters, published listings, DNS records) that random pool assignment alone cannot solve. It is lower priority than pool selection (which is more common), but essential for operators who have already advertised their server.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested independently by requesting a specific address, noting that address, deleting and recreating the server (or triggering a pod restart), and confirming the same address is reassigned to the new server instance.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a cluster with available addresses in a pool, **When** an operator creates a server and specifies a preferred address (in addition to or instead of a pool name), **Then** if that address is available, the server is assigned that specific address.
2. **Given** that address is now in use, **When** the operator later tries to create a new server and request the same address, **Then** the server creation is rejected or warned with a message like "Address X.X.X.X is already in use by [other-server]".
3. **Given** a server assigned to a specific address that is later released (server deleted), **When** the address is freed, **Then** the address becomes available for reassignment to another server (no permanent lock or orphaning).

---

### User Story 5 - Operator edits Nuclear Option server settings and invalid configuration surfaces as a clear error (Priority: P3)

An operator wants to change the server's name, password, or mission rotation without restarting manually. They edit the settings in the dashboard, and if they make a mistake (e.g., invalid JSON in a custom config, unsupported mission name, max-players value outside valid range), the system rejects the change with a clear, actionable error message rather than letting the server crash or hang.

**Why this priority**: Configuration validation is essential for a stable user experience but is lower priority than basic deployment and pool selection. A clear error message avoids frustration and enables operators to self-serve rather than asking support.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested independently by attempting several configuration edits: one valid (changes take effect on restart), and several invalid (server name too long, password with forbidden characters, mission name not in the rotation list, max-players below 1 or above 64). Each invalid edit is rejected with a message that names the problem field and suggests a fix.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a running Nuclear Option server, **When** an operator edits the server name to a valid value (e.g., "My Awesome Server") and attempts to save, **Then** the dashboard validates the change, accepts it, and marks the server as "Configuration Changed — Restart Required" or similar.
2. **Given** an operator editing the server name to an invalid value (e.g., a string 256+ characters), **When** they try to save, **Then** the dashboard validates the change, rejects it with a message like "Server name must be 1–64 characters", and does not apply the change.
3. **Given** the server is restarted with the new valid name, **When** the server boots, **Then** the new name is reflected in the config file and in the in-game server browser.
4. **Given** an operator editing the mission rotation or other game settings via a JSON text field, **When** the JSON is malformed and they attempt to save, **Then** the dashboard validates the JSON format, rejects it with "Invalid JSON in [field]: [specific error]", and does not apply the change (preventing the server from entering a crash loop on the next restart).

---

### User Story 6 - Operator gets a clear status message when address pool assignment fails (Priority: P3)

An operator creates a server with a pool preference but nothing happens — no address is assigned, and the server stays in a "Pending" state indefinitely. Instead, the dashboard clearly tells the operator why: the pool does not exist in the cluster, the pool has no available addresses, the requested address is already in use, or the exposure mode is set to something other than "Load Balancer" (which is incompatible with pool selection).

**Why this priority**: Error clarity is important for self-service operation but lower priority than the happy path. Operators need to understand why their request was not fulfilled so they can fix it.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested independently by triggering each failure scenario (nonexistent pool name, exhausted pool, conflicting address, wrong exposure mode) and confirming the dashboard displays a distinct, readable error message for each, making it clear what went wrong and how to fix it.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** an operator creating a server with a pool name that does not exist in the cluster, **When** the server is submitted, **Then** the status immediately shows "Pool 'unknown-pool' not found in cluster" or similar, allowing the operator to choose a different pool.
2. **Given** a pool that has no available addresses (all addresses in use or exhausted), **When** an operator creates a server requesting that pool, **Then** the status shows "Address pool 'pool-name' is exhausted; no addresses available" (not a hanging "Pending" state).
3. **Given** an operator requesting a specific address that is already assigned to another server, **When** the request is submitted, **Then** the status shows "Address X.X.X.X is already in use by [server-name]; choose a different address or pool" with a link to view the conflicting server.
4. **Given** an operator setting the exposure mode to "Internal" (ClusterIP) while also specifying a pool preference (which requires LoadBalancer), **When** the server is created, **Then** the dashboard warns "Pool preference is ignored when exposure mode is not 'Load Balancer'" and does not assign a public address.

---

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a Nuclear Option server's JSON config file becomes malformed (e.g., corruption, partial write)? The operator must be able to detect this via the server status or logs, and either fix it manually or trigger a rollback/restart with a known-good config.
- How does pool reassignment work if the server is live with active players? Does the player see a brief disconnect while the address changes, or is the address sticky for the lifetime of the server instance? The spec assumes the address is fixed for a server's lifetime (no mid-flight reassignment without a deliberate restart), but this must be clarified against real load-balancer behavior.
- What if the cluster's address manager (e.g., MetalLB, Cilium) does not support pool names or explicit address requests? The spec must work with any CNCF-standard address manager, either by falling back to a generic preference hint or by documenting which managers are compatible.
- Can an operator set a pool preference on a running server created before the IP pool feature existed (i.e., already has an address)? If so, does it trigger a reassignment or stay on the original address?
- What happens if two servers request the same specific address at the same time? The cluster's address manager's concurrency handling is authoritative, but the dashboard must reflect the outcome (one succeeds, one is told the address is taken).
- Nuclear Option's remote-command JSON protocol is documented in third-party sources, not the official Steam documentation (see Verification Required Before Implementation, Claim 3). If the protocol changes in a future game update, drift is detected and handled via the real-world protocol-level E2E test (per the constitution); a test failure signals that the assumed protocol or ports are no longer valid.
- The Nuclear Option dedicated server is believed to be a separate binary (app ID 3930080, per third-party hosting-provider documentation, not confirmed against Steam's own store listing; see Verification Required Before Implementation, Claim 1) from the base game (app 2168680). Can the operator update the binary without manually pulling a new module/image? (This is a templating/upgrade-policy question, out of scope for this spec but noted as a known gap.)
- Nuclear Option's server logs are assumed to be readable by the agent for status/backup purposes, consistent with every other supported module (see Verification Required Before Implementation, Claim 5). The exact on-disk log location for this specific game must be verified during implementation.
- Does the dedicated server expose any signal that distinguishes "process started" from "actually accepting player connections"? This has not been confirmed (see Verification Required Before Implementation, Claim 4). If no such signal exists, "Accepting Players" status (User Story 1, Acceptance Scenario 2) must be inferred conservatively (e.g., from the same real-protocol probe used by the join test).
- If a mission name in the config becomes invalid (the mission is removed from the game in an update), the server may fail to load that mission. The operator must be able to either revert the mission or pick a different one from the current valid list.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

**Nuclear Option Module:**

- **FR-001**: The Nuclear Option game module MUST be available in the catalog and selectable by operators for deployment just like any other supported game.
- **FR-002**: The Nuclear Option module MUST include a server template with sensible resource defaults: CPU allocation of 2–4 cores (CPU-bound workload), memory allocation of 8 GB minimum and 16 GB recommended, and 30 GB of storage for the game binary and mission data.
- **FR-003**: Operators MUST be able to configure the Nuclear Option server's settings (server name, password, max-player limit, mission rotation mode, mission list) via the dashboard's server configuration form, with validation applied to each field.
- **FR-004**: The Nuclear Option server MUST be recorded in docs/game-coverage.md with a join-coverage status (covered-in-ci, covered-deferred, blocked-doc, or out-of-scope-by-design) by the time the module ships, per feature 001's coverage framework. If the join protocol is documented well enough to build a client, a real protocol-join E2E test MUST be committed to test/e2e/ (with JoinDepth JOINED per the data model); the test MUST be bucketed in test/e2e/buckets.sh, and the module's row in docs/game-coverage.md MUST reflect its status and bucket. **Unverified:** The game port is assumed to be UDP 7777 per third-party hosting-provider documentation (see Verification Required Before Implementation, Claim 2), and a real join using that port is assumed possible without platform-specific credentials. If the protocol proves undocumented or the port incorrect, the module is marked blocked-doc and names the specific artifact required to unblock it (e.g., packet capture, reverse-engineered field map) per feature 001 FR-010.
- **FR-005**: If the Nuclear Option join protocol can be documented and a test authored, that test MUST be verified to fail when run against a non-listening address and to succeed when run against a real, booted Nuclear Option server before it is committed, per the project constitution's E2E-Tested Delivery principle. If protocol reverse-engineering or platform constraints make a join test infeasible, the module's coverage status becomes blocked-doc (with the specific blocker named) or out-of-scope-by-design (if the constraint is architectural), per feature 001 FR-008.
- **FR-006**: The Nuclear Option server's Remote Console interface MUST support the remote-command protocol, with moderation commands (get-player-list, kick, ban, broadcast, mission-set) functional via that interface. **Unverified:** The protocol is assumed to be a length-prefixed JSON request/response scheme on a dedicated remote-command port, separate from the game and query ports, based on third-party hosting-provider documentation. The specific port numbers are deliberately not restated here — see Verification Required Before Implementation, Claim 2, so there is one place to correct when they are confirmed. Because this protocol is not officially documented by the game's publisher, its exact shape (port, framing, command names, result-code semantics) MUST be confirmed against a real running server during implementation. If the protocol proves undocumented or incompatible with the assumed ports, the E2E join test and Remote Console coverage MUST record that drift; the module's coverage status becomes blocked-doc with the specific reverse-engineering artifact required to proceed, or transitions to out-of-scope-by-design if the protocol proves permanently inaccessible.
- **FR-007**: Operators MUST be able to view a list of connected players (Steam ID, display name, faction) via a Remote Console command, with the results displayed in the console output.
- **FR-008**: Operators MUST be able to kick a connected player by Steam ID via a Remote Console command, disconnecting that player from the server.
- **FR-009**: Operators MUST be able to add a Steam ID to the server's ban list via a Remote Console command, preventing that Steam ID from joining.
- **FR-010**: Operators MUST be able to remove a Steam ID from the server's ban list via a Remote Console command.
- **FR-011**: Operators MUST be able to broadcast a chat message to all connected players on the Nuclear Option server via a Remote Console command.
- **FR-012**: Operators MUST be able to change the next mission in the rotation and adjust the time remaining in the current mission via Remote Console commands.
- **FR-013**: Nuclear Option servers MUST support full backup and restore workflows (snapshot of configuration, missions, ban list, and logs) using Gameplane's existing backup and restore capabilities, with no Nuclear-Option-specific backup tooling required.

**Load-Balancer IP Pool Override:**

- **FR-014**: Operators MUST be able to specify a load-balancer address pool preference when creating or editing a GameServer's networking settings.
- **FR-015**: Operators MUST be able to request a specific IP address (instead of or in addition to a pool name) for a server's public endpoint.
- **FR-016**: When a GameServer is created with a pool preference set and the exposure mode is "Load Balancer", the server's assigned public address MUST come from that pool, not the default pool.
- **FR-017**: When a GameServer is created with no pool preference set, the server MUST be assigned an address from the cluster's default load-balancer pool, maintaining backward compatibility with servers created before the pool-override feature.
- **FR-018**: When a GameServer's exposure mode is set to anything other than "Load Balancer" (e.g., Internal/ClusterIP, Node Port, Host Port), any pool preference MUST be ignored and a dashboard warning MUST indicate that the pool setting has no effect.
- **FR-019**: The operator MUST be able to view the server's assigned public address and, if applicable, the address pool it came from, displayed prominently in the server's networking details in the dashboard.
- **FR-020**: When a pool assignment cannot be fulfilled (pool does not exist, pool is exhausted, requested address is in use, or exposure mode is incompatible), the GameServer status MUST display a distinct, readable error message naming the specific reason and the corrective action available, rather than remaining in an indefinite "Pending" state.
- **FR-021**: A GameServer whose pool preference is set via the REST API, or applied directly to the cluster without going through the dashboard, MUST be assigned an address using the same pool-assignment logic as one created through the dashboard — since reconciliation is driven by the GameServer record itself, not by which path created it.
- **FR-022**: The pool-override feature MUST support MetalLB and Cilium load-balancer address managers. **Amendment (2026-08-22)**: The implementation does NOT use a generic mechanism; instead, it contains two hand-written per-manager translation branches in `operator/internal/controller/gameserver_controller.go::reconcileService()`, selected by an explicit `--address-manager` flavor flag at operator startup (values: `metallb`, `cilium`, `none`). MetalLB translation sets the `metallb.io/address-pool` annotation on the Service; Cilium translation sets the `gameplane.local/lb-pool` label and `lbipam.cilium.io/ips` annotation. A generic mechanism is not possible: MetalLB and Cilium expose fundamentally incompatible vendor-specific surfaces (MetalLB requires an annotation, Cilium requires a label *and* a cluster admin mirror of that label in the CiliumLoadBalancerIPPool's `spec.serviceSelector`), and they report pool-assignment failures differently (MetalLB via Events, Cilium via a Service condition). Supporting an additional address manager requires adding a new translation branch and flavor value in the operator code.

**Cross-Cutting & Validation:**

- **FR-023**: Invalid Nuclear Option configuration (malformed JSON config, unsupported mission names, invalid player caps) MUST be detected and reported as a clear validation error before the server attempts to boot, preventing crash-loops or hung servers.
- **FR-024**: The dashboard MUST display the server's current configuration and status for Nuclear Option in the same layout and detail as other game types, with no Nuclear-Option-specific UI or extra steps required to view/edit settings.
- **FR-025**: Both the operator and the system MUST be able to read the assigned address pool name and/or explicit address from a GameServer created either via dashboard or REST API, ensuring visibility and auditability.
- **FR-026**: Nuclear Option's join-coverage status MUST be verified by the test/e2e/joincoverage.sh verifier gate before the module ships, per feature 001. The module's row in docs/game-coverage.md MUST record either covered-in-ci (if a real join test runs in a default CI bucket), covered-deferred (if the test is authored and committed but excluded from CI due to resource constraints, with a lastVerified date), or blocked-doc/out-of-scope-by-design (if the protocol cannot be tested). If the game server is too resource-heavy to run in the default CI runners, its real protocol-level join test MUST still be authored and committed to `test/e2e/`; it MUST be excluded from all CI bucket execution in `test/e2e/buckets.sh` with a comment explaining the exclusion, and MUST remain runnable on demand (against a manually provided cluster or triggered via workflow).
- **FR-027**: Documentation MUST describe the Nuclear Option module's setup, configuration options, remote-console command syntax, resource requirements, and any known limitations or workarounds, including the module's `specs.md` (per the project's per-module documentation convention). This documentation MUST be updated in the same change as any change to the module's actual behavior, so it never drifts from what the module does.

### Key Entities

- **Game Module (Nuclear Option)**: A deployable game template representing the Nuclear Option dedicated server; has a configuration schema (name, password, max-players, mission rotation), port exposure settings, and resource defaults (8–16 GB RAM, 2–4 CPU, 30 GB storage). Exact port assignments (game, query, and remote-command ports) are assumed from third-party documentation and unconfirmed against the publisher — see Assumptions.
- **Game Server (Nuclear Option instance)**: A running instance of the Nuclear Option module, with a lifecycle (Pending, Running, Suspended, Failed) and a networking configuration (exposure mode, pool preference, assigned address).
- **Address Pool**: A named group of public IP addresses (or address ranges) managed by the cluster's load-balancer controller. Examples: "production-us-east", "testing-tier", or "default".
- **Pool Preference**: An optional operator-set constraint on a GameServer specifying which address pool should provide its public endpoint.
- **Assigned Public Address**: The actual IP address (or FQDN) that the cluster's address manager assigns to a server's public network endpoint, visible to external clients for joining.
- **Remote Console Session**: An interactive channel allowing the operator to send commands (get-player-list, kick, ban, broadcast, mission-set) to the Nuclear Option server and receive parsed responses.
- **Player Entry**: A record of a connected player to a Nuclear Option server, with Steam ID, display name, and faction.
- **Ban List Entry**: A persistent entry (Steam ID) in the server's ban list, preventing that player from joining.
- **Mission Rotation**: The sequence of missions that the server will cycle through, configurable by the operator.
- **Server Configuration**: The JSON-format configuration file for a Nuclear Option server (server name, password, max-players, mission list, voting parameters, etc.).

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: An operator can deploy a playable Nuclear Option server from the catalog and have a real player join it within 5 minutes from clicking "Deploy" (measured from server creation to a confirmed join).
- **SC-002**: 100% of pool-assignment requests for servers with a valid pool preference set result in the server being assigned an address from the requested pool (no false failures or silent fallbacks).
- **SC-003**: Within 30 seconds of a pool misconfiguration (nonexistent pool, exhausted pool, conflicting address), the dashboard status displays the specific error message (not a generic "Pending" or timeout).
- **SC-004**: An operator can execute a moderation command (kick, ban, broadcast, mission-set) on a Nuclear Option server and see the result reflected on the server within 5 seconds of issuing the command.
- **SC-005**: Nuclear Option's join-coverage status (covered-in-ci, covered-deferred, blocked-doc, or out-of-scope-by-design) is recorded in docs/game-coverage.md at ship time per feature 001's framework; test/e2e/joincoverage.sh verify confirms the record is complete and consistent. A module must never be shipped with an unknown or unrecorded coverage status.
- **SC-006**: Servers created without a pool preference set (backward-compatible case) continue to receive addresses from the default pool. **Amendment (2026-08-22)**: The latency-parity claim ("no change in behavior or latency compared to the previous release") is **unmeasured and out of scope for v1**. What IS verifiable: a server with no pool preference receives an address from the cluster's default pool, with no annotation or label written to its Service (preserving pre-feature behavior), and `reconcileService()` takes the same code path as before (no new branching or delay). A real latency measurement would require (1) a baseline from a pre-feature build, (2) a test environment with stable load characteristics, and (3) a defined latency metric (time-to-address-assignment from Service creation). This measurement is deferred to a future operational audit and is not part of v1 acceptance.
- **SC-007**: Invalid Nuclear Option configuration (malformed JSON, unsupported mission, out-of-range player limit) surfaces as a validation error within 10 seconds of the server attempting to boot, preventing the server from entering a crash-loop or hung state.
- **SC-008**: The assigned public address for a newly created server is visible in the dashboard networking details within 30 seconds of the address manager assigning it.

## Assumptions

- **BLOCKING RISK (unverified precondition):** This spec assumes the Nuclear Option dedicated server (believed to be Steam app 3930080, per third-party hosting-provider documentation, not the publisher's own listing) is publicly downloadable, requires no ownership of the base game, and ships a native Linux build. None of that is confirmed, and nothing here asserts it as fact — it is the precondition the whole module rests on. If any of these prove false — licensing restrictions on the dedicated server, no Linux binary, base-game ownership requirement, or platform-only distribution — the module cannot ship. The feature's scope will shift to documenting that licensing/platform blocker rather than proceeding with a legally unlicensable or technically unbuildable template. This risk MUST be resolved before implementation begins.
- The exact network footprint of the dedicated server — a UDP game port, a separate UDP query port, and a separate remote-command port — is unverified. Commonly cited in third-party hosting-provider docs as ports 7777/7778/7779, but these MUST be confirmed against a live running server. The remote-command protocol itself is unverified and assumed to be a length-prefixed JSON request/response scheme with numeric result-code ranges, based only on third-party operator guides and forums (never the publisher). All details — exact ports, wire format, command names, result-code semantics — MUST be confirmed against a real running server during implementation before the moderation commands (FR-007–FR-012) are implemented. The real-protocol E2E join test (FR-004) serves as the verification mechanism; if assumptions prove wrong or upstream changes, the test must fail and signal the drift per feature 001 FR-009.
- Whether the dedicated server exposes any signal distinguishing "process has started" from "server is actually accepting player connections" is unverified. Readiness reporting in the dashboard MUST be derived from the most reliable signal actually available once confirmed during implementation, not assumed to be a simple process-liveness check. If no such signal exists, "Accepting Players" status must be conservatively inferred (e.g., from the same real-protocol probe used by the join test).
- Pool selection is expected to be implemented via whatever mechanism the cluster's address manager (e.g., MetalLB, Cilium) exposes for expressing a pool or address preference on a load-balancer-type endpoint. Gameplane does not itself manage address allocation — it only records the operator's preference and reports back the system's assigned address. The specific mechanism is a planning-phase decision, not specified here.
- The pool-preference setting is only visible and editable by users who already have permission to edit a server's networking settings (i.e., no new RBAC role is required; the feature re-uses existing networking permissions).
- A server's assigned public address is fixed for the lifetime of that server instance. Changing the pool preference on a running server either triggers a pod restart (with a brief service interruption while a new address is assigned) or the change is deferred until the next operator-initiated restart. The exact behavior is a planning-phase decision; this spec assumes one consistent behavior across all cases.
- No per-tenant pool quotas, allow-lists, or advanced scheduling policies are in scope for v1. Any operator with permission to create a GameServer can request any pool. Advanced policies (per-user/per-namespace pool restrictions) are roadmap items.
- Nuclear Option's resource footprint (~8–16 GB RAM, single-core CPU-bound, 30 GB storage) is modest enough that the server can be tested on a real cluster in CI under operator-provided conditions. However, if the server is determined to be too heavy for the default GitHub Actions runners, the E2E test is still authored and committed but excluded from the CI buckets, per the project constitution.
- The term "load-balancer" includes any Kubernetes LoadBalancer-type Service (MetalLB, cloud-provider LBs, Cilium). If a cluster uses a different exposure mechanism (e.g., Ingress-only, no external IPs), the pool-override feature has no effect and the dashboard indicates this clearly.
- Existing servers with no pool preference will continue to work unchanged. There is no migration effort, data conversion, or backward-compatibility breaking change.

## Verification Required Before Implementation

The following unverified claims MUST be confirmed before implementation begins. Each claim is listed with the evidence that would confirm it, and the action if the claim proves false.

**Claim 1: Dedicated Server Availability & Platform**

*Unverified:* The Nuclear Option dedicated server (Steam app 3930080) is publicly downloadable without owning the base game and has a native Linux build.

*Evidence Required:* Proof that the dedicated server binary is available via Steam on a system that owns neither the base game (2168680) nor the dedicated server app; confirmation that the Linux binary exists and is not merely a compatibility layer (Proton/WINE); confirmation that the Linux binary can start and accept game connections.

*Fallback if False:* The module cannot ship. Feature scope reduces to documenting the licensing/platform blocker in a template that explains why Gameplane cannot distribute it.

**Claim 2: Network Ports**

*Unverified:* The dedicated server listens on UDP port 7777 (game), UDP port 7778 (query), and (implicitly) a remote-command port on 7779, as cited in third-party docs.

*Evidence Required:* Netstat output from a running Nuclear Option server confirming actual listening ports and protocols (UDP vs. TCP, explicit confirmation of 7777, 7778, 7779 or the actual ports if different); confirmation that these ports can be externally reachable.

*Fallback if False:* The ports embedded in the module template are wrong; they MUST be corrected based on the real server's behavior. The E2E join test and port documentation (FR-019, FR-027) are updated accordingly.

**Claim 3: Remote-Command Protocol Format**

*Unverified:* The remote-command protocol is a length-prefixed JSON request/response scheme with numeric result-code ranges and the specific command names (get-player-list, kick-player, banlist-add, send-chat-message, set-next-mission, etc.) as assumed.

*Evidence Required:* A packet capture from a real Nuclear Option server responding to remote commands (or tcpdump of RCON interactions if the protocol is documented elsewhere); reverse-engineered field map showing exact wire format (byte offsets, data types, enum values); confirmation that the assumed commands exist and their signatures match.

*Fallback if False:* The moderation commands (FR-007–FR-012) must be reworked to match the actual protocol. If the protocol is undocumented, the module's coverage becomes blocked-doc, naming the specific reverse-engineering artifact required (e.g., "Packet capture of real RCON session").

**Claim 4: Readiness Signal**

*Unverified:* The dedicated server exposes some signal (log output, status port response, config state) that distinguishes "process started" from "accepting player connections."

*Evidence Required:* Observation of the log output, network responses, or state files from a real running server over its boot sequence; identification of the exact moment the server is playable; confirmation that this moment is reliably detectable without a real join attempt.

*Fallback if False:* If no reliable signal exists, dashboard readiness must be conservatively inferred from the same protocol probe used by the E2E join test (i.e., only report "Accepting Players" after a successful join probe). This increases readiness-check latency but ensures accuracy.

**Claim 5: On-Disk Log Location & Format**

*Unverified:* The server's logs are written to a filesystem location accessible by the agent pod (assumed to be standard game directories like `/game/logs/`, `~/saves/logs/`, or similar) and are in a parseable format (plain text, JSON, or structured log).

*Evidence Required:* Real server instance running in a pod or container showing actual log file locations and format; confirmation that log rotation and retention are manageable; confirmation that the agent's read permissions can access these logs.

*Fallback if False:* If logs are inaccessible or in an unparseable format, the module's operational usability degrades (operator visibility into server health/events is reduced); documentation must note this limitation. Backup of configuration/ban-list may still be possible, but log inclusion in backups becomes optional.

## Out of Scope

- **Address pool creation and management**: Gameplane does not create or manage address pools. Pools must be created and configured by the cluster operator (via MetalLB/Cilium/other address manager configuration), and Gameplane only consumes pool names/hints the operator provides.
- **IPv6-specific behavior**: The feature works with IPv6 addresses (they are treated identically to IPv4), but advanced IPv6-only features (dual-stack handling, IPv6-specific pool policies) are not required.
- **Per-tenant pool quotas or allow-lists**: Administrators cannot restrict which pools specific users or namespaces can request; any user with GameServer-edit permissions can use any pool.
- **Nuclear Option mod support**: The feature does not support BepInEx mods, third-party mods, or custom mod loading. Only the unmodded dedicated server is in scope.
- **Dynamic address reassignment without restart**: A server's address does not change without a deliberate operator action (restart, manual reassignment). Address reassignment due to cluster rebalancing is handled by the address manager, but Gameplane does not drive this.
- **Custom mission authoring tooling**: The feature does not provide UI for creating or uploading custom missions. Operators use only missions included in the game or configured externally.
- **Multi-cluster address pools**: Pools are cluster-local. Multi-cluster federation (addressing across multiple physical Kubernetes clusters as one pool) is out of scope.
