## Status Vocabulary

The status values used in the submission table follow this vocabulary (D-D):

- **`pending`** — Submission has not been made. Target is eligible and authorized.
- **`in-progress [YYYY-MM-DD]`** — Submission is in flight (draft prepared, account created, form submitted to third party). Date is when work started.
- **`submitted [YYYY-MM-DD]`** — Submission has been completed (PR opened, form submitted, email sent). Date is the submission date. Terminal state.
- **`rejected [YYYY-MM-DD, reason]`** — Third party rejected the submission. Date and reason must be present. Terminal state.
- **`deferred [YYYY-MM-DD, reason]`** — Submission is not currently possible due to blockers (age requirement, eligibility unknown, etc.). Reason explains blocker and may include future-eligibility date. Terminal state.

**Note on third-party acceptance (FR-023)**: Acceptance or rejection by a third party (e.g., a PR merged by Awesome-Selfhosted) is recorded in the "Notes / History" column only. It does not change the submission status in this table.

## Next Steps

1. **AlternativeTo**: Maintainer creates free account (requires email verification), prepares submission form with template content above, submits.
2. **Awesome-Selfhosted**: Deferred until 2026-10-22 (4-month eligibility date). No action required during this feature; re-evaluate after the date if desired.
3. **Awesome-Kubernetes**: Deferred per OD-6b; no pre-check task or submission attempt. Revisit in a later release if metrics improve or maintainer explicitly authorizes.
