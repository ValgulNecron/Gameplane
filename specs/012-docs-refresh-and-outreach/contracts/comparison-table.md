# Contract: README Comparison Table and Source Documentation

**Status**: Specification (Ruled 2026-09-02 — Ready for Implementation)  
**Feature Branch**: `012-docs-refresh-and-outreach`  
**Applies To**: README.md placement and `docs/comparison-sources.md` schema

---

## 1. README.md Placement (FR-001, D-H)

The comparison table MUST be placed in README.md immediately after the "## Why Gameplane?" section and before the "## Features" section.

**Current line references**:
- "## Why Gameplane?" starts at line 42
- "## Features" starts at line 48
- **Insertion point**: between lines 47 and 48

**Placement specification**:
```
## Why Gameplane?

[existing text about Kubernetes-native architecture...]

[FR-004 STATUS LINE appears here]

[COMPARISON TABLE appears here]

## Features

[existing feature list...]
```

---

## 2. README.md Comparison Table: Intro Paragraph Requirement (OD-12)

An introductory paragraph MUST appear immediately above the comparison table explaining the scope and category differences:

```markdown
Gameplane is compared to Pterodactyl and CubeCoders AMP (both control panels)
and Agones (a Kubernetes operator library). While not direct competitors,
Agones is included as a reference point for teams building on Kubernetes
primitives.
```

**Placement order** (OD-12):
1. Intro paragraph (scope and category clarification)
2. FR-004 status line (below)
3. Comparison table (below)

**Requirement**: This intro educates evaluators about the different product categories and prevents misreading Agones as a direct control panel competitor.

---

## 3. FR-004 Status Line (Verbatim)

Directly below the intro paragraph, include this status line without modification:

```markdown
Status: **beta** (`v0.2.0-beta.8`). The operator, API, agent, and dashboard
are feature-complete for the v1 scope and stabilized for external testing.
```

**Evidence**: README.md:8–9  
**Requirement**: Exact verbatim text per spec FR-004; this replaces any inline "beta" qualifiers in the table header.

---

## 4. Table Structure: Header Row and Column Order

The comparison table MUST use GitHub-flavored Markdown table syntax with this exact column order and header:

```markdown
| Dimension | Gameplane | Pterodactyl | CubeCoders AMP | Agones |
|-----------|-----------|-------------|----------------|--------|
```

Column order is fixed per spec FR-002 (not alphabetical): Gameplane, Pterodactyl, CubeCoders AMP, Agones.

---

## 5. Comparison Table: Row Labels and Order (FR-002)

The table MUST contain exactly nine rows in this order, with exact label text per FR-002 (a) through (i):

| Row # | Exact Label Text | FR-002 Reference |
|-------|------------------|------------------|
| 1 | Deployment/runtime model | (a) |
| 2 | Scaling & auto-sleep | (b) |
| 3 | Inbound connectivity (NAT traversal, relay) | (c) |
| 4 | Backup and restore | (d) |
| 5 | Access control & authentication | (e) |
| 6 | Game template distribution | (f) |
| 7 | Multi-tenancy & multi-cluster | (g) |
| 8 | Licensing | (h) |
| 9 | Target operator scope (self-hosted vs. managed SaaS) | (i) |

**Label precision requirement**: Each row label MUST match the exact text above, including punctuation, parenthetical qualifications, and capitalization. No rewording or abbreviation.

---

## 6. Gameplane Column (FR-003, D-A)

Each Gameplane cell MUST:

1. **State a factual capability** (max ~25 words), not a judgment
2. **Inline all qualifiers** using D-C vocabulary: `[BETA]`, `[optional]`, `[experimental]`, `[disabled by default]`, `[local cluster only]`, or similar
3. **Include a bracketed marker** `[G-x]` that links to `docs/comparison-sources.md#gameplane-row-x`, where `x` is the dimension letter (a, b, c, etc.)
4. **Evidence citation**: Each cell's claim must be traceable to one or more source paths: CRD types (`operator/api/v1alpha1/*_types.go`), README.md, docs/, CLAUDE.md, or values.yaml

### Gameplane Cell Template

```markdown
[<factual claim with inline qualifiers>] [G-a]
```

### Gameplane Column Content (R5-verified facts, with qualifiers)

| Row | Gameplane Cell Content |
|-----|------------------------|
| (a) Deployment/runtime model | Kubernetes-native CRDs and controller-runtime operator; scales from k3s homelab to multi-node clusters. [BETA] [G-a] |
| (b) Scaling & auto-sleep | Opt-in idle auto-sleep with configurable wake windows, manual wake button, or wake-on-connect. Minecraft/Terraria full protocol support; others use packet heuristics. [optional] [G-b] |
| (c) Inbound connectivity (NAT traversal, relay) | Integrated frp, Tailscale, playit relay sidecars; playit mappings user-managed via playit.gg account. [optional; disabled by default] [G-c] |
| (d) Backup and restore | Restic snapshots to S3-compatible storage; on-demand or cron-scheduled via BackupSchedule; one-click restore. [G-d] |
| (e) Access control & authentication | Local argon2id + OIDC (Keycloak/Google/GitHub); three built-in roles (admin/operator/viewer); custom roles supported. [G-e] |
| (f) Game template distribution | OCI bundles via ModuleSource (git/http/oci/local/upload); optional cosign signature verification per source. 16 ready-to-use templates shipped. [G-f] |
| (g) Multi-tenancy & multi-cluster | Cluster CRD for remote registration/monitoring; console/log streaming local-cluster only. [local cluster only for streaming] [G-g] |
| (h) Licensing | GNU Affero General Public License v3.0 or later (AGPL-3.0-or-later). [G-h] |
| (i) Target operator scope (self-hosted vs. managed SaaS) | Self-hosted only; runs on Kubernetes (k3s, kubeadm, managed services); no managed SaaS offering. [G-i] |

---

## 7. Competitor Columns (FR-005, FR-006)

Each competitor cell MUST:

1. **State only factual, verifiable features** — no speculation, judgment, or unverifiable claims
2. **Include a bracketed source marker** `[<ABBREV>-<row>]` that links to `docs/comparison-sources.md#<anchor>`
3. **Leave placeholders for implementation**: `<to be researched during implementation; source required>`
4. **Qualify with uncertainty** (OD-9, OD-10): If information cannot be verified:
   - **For CubeCoders AMP** (no fetchable official source): Use exact text `not publicly documented (checked YYYY-MM-DD)` [C-<row>]
   - **For 404 Pterodactyl/Agones URLs** (unsuccessful hunt on site + archive.org): Use exact text `source URL unavailable (checked YYYY-MM-DD)` [<ABBREV>-<row>]

### Source Marker Syntax

The marker format is: `[<ABBREV>-<dimension-letter>]`

Where:
- `<ABBREV>` is the competitor abbreviation:
  - `P` = Pterodactyl
  - `C` = CubeCoders AMP
  - `A` = Agones
- `<dimension-letter>` is the row identifier (a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h, i)

Example marker: `[P-a]` links to `docs/comparison-sources.md#pterodactyl-row-a`

### Competitor Column Template

```markdown
<factual claim describing feature or absence> [<ABBREV>-<dimension>]
```

If the cell cannot be verified, use:

```markdown
<to be researched during implementation; source required> [<ABBREV>-<dimension>]
```

### Competitor Column Placeholder Content

Each cell MUST contain exactly this placeholder (per FR-005, competitors are researched during implementation):

```markdown
<to be researched during implementation; source required> [<ABBREV>-x]
```

Where `x` is the dimension letter (a–i). The placeholder is a temporary token that will be replaced during implementation with actual findings and a dated source marker.

**Exception for Agones (OD-11)**: For dimensions where Agones (a Kubernetes library, not a control panel) does not apply, use the exact text:

```markdown
not applicable (Agones is a Kubernetes operator library) [A-x]
```

Dimensions typically N/A for Agones: Access control & authentication (library users have no dashboard users), Game template distribution (no template system), Backup and restore (K8s state is not a game server concern). Implementation MUST verify each dimension before marking N/A.

---

## 8. Table Cell Grammar Rules (FR-006, SC-001)

Every table cell MUST conform to these grammar and content rules:

1. **Factual, not judgmental**: Describe feature presence/absence and design choices, never state value judgments.
   - ✓ Good: "Local argon2id + OIDC support; three built-in roles"
   - ✗ Bad: "Superior authentication with flexible roles"

2. **Verifiable, not speculative**: State only what is publicly documented or observable in code.
   - ✓ Good: "Opt-in idle auto-sleep with configurable windows"
   - ✗ Bad: "Might support resource scaling in the future"

3. **Concise** (max ~25 words per cell): Long descriptions are moved to linked documentation.

4. **Qualifier tags inline**: Tag the feature state inline within the cell, not in a separate column.
   - ✓ Good: "Sentinel [optional] wake-on-connect for Minecraft/Terraria"
   - ✗ Bad: (cell) "Sentinel wake-on-connect" / (separate column) "Optional (Minecraft/Terraria)"

5. **"Not applicable" allowed**: If a feature dimension genuinely does not apply to a product (e.g., Agones does not have backup features per traditional control panel design), state `Not applicable` and cite why (if relevant).

---

## 9. docs/comparison-sources.md Schema and Structure

A new file `docs/comparison-sources.md` MUST be created with the following structure:

### File Header

```markdown
# Comparison Table Sources

This file documents the sources and verification dates for every claim in the
README comparison table. Each product has a section below. Entries are organized
by row (dimension a–i) and include the source URL, date checked, and what was
verified.

**Last Updated**: [YYYY-MM-DD during implementation]

---
```

### Per-Product Section Template

Each product has its own top-level section with subsections for each dimension:

```markdown
## <Product Name>

**License**: [License name and link]  
**Documentation Root**: [URL]  
**Repository**: [URL or "proprietary/unavailable"]

### Row (a): Deployment/runtime model

**Source ID**: [ABBREV]-a  
**URL**: [Canonical source for this dimension]  
**Checked on**: YYYY-MM-DD  
**What was verified**: [Brief description of what the source stated]  
**Last-known URL**: [Fallback URL if primary goes down]

[Repeat for rows b–i]
```

### Section Anchors

Each dimension row MUST have an anchor derivable from the source ID. Anchor format:

```markdown
### Row (<letter>): <dimension-label>
```

GitHub automatically generates anchors from heading text as `#row-<letter>-<dimension-label-slug>`.

Example: Row (a) heading generates anchor `#row-a-deployment-runtime-model`

Marker `[P-a]` in the table links to this anchor explicitly as `docs/comparison-sources.md#pterodactyl-row-a` (custom anchor).

**Custom anchor requirement**: Add explicit HTML anchors for clarity:

```markdown
### Row (a): Deployment/runtime model {#pterodactyl-row-a}
```

This ensures `[P-a]` link resolves precisely.

### Canonical Source Domains (R7)

Competitor sources MUST come from these official roots only:

| Product | Allowed Domains |
|---------|-----------------|
| Pterodactyl | https://pterodactyl.io/ (docs), https://github.com/pterodactyl/ (repo, license) |
| CubeCoders AMP | https://www.cubecoders.com/ (attempts to verify; if inaccessible, note as "proprietary, unverifiable") |
| Agones | https://agones.dev/site/docs/ (docs), https://github.com/agones-dev/ (repo, license) |

**CubeCoders exception** (R7, OD-9): If the website is not directly accessible via WebFetch or browsable by standard tools, document this clearly with the status "Proprietary; official documentation not directly verifiable via automated means. Recommend manual browser research during implementation or deferral with justification."

**404 fallback sourcing** (R7, OD-10): When dimension-specific documentation URLs return HTTP 404 (for Pterodactyl or Agones), implementation hunts the site and archive.org. If no alternate URL is found, the cell uses the exact text: `source URL unavailable (checked YYYY-MM-DD)` [<ABBREV>-<row>]. Implementation MUST record the hunt results (dates checked, sites searched) in docs/comparison-sources.md.

---

## 10. Table Rendering on GitHub (FR-007)

When committed and viewed on GitHub, the comparison table MUST:

1. Render as a readable Markdown table with aligned columns
2. Have clickable links in the bracket markers `[G-a]`, `[P-a]`, etc. pointing to `docs/comparison-sources.md`
3. Display inline qualifiers `[BETA]`, `[optional]`, etc. in monospace or as-is
4. Preserve line breaks and formatting without spurious HTML escaping

**Test** (before merge): View the README on GitHub and confirm the table renders as intended.

## 12. Resolved Open Questions (OD-1 through OD-12, ruled 2026-09-02)

The following open questions (OD) from the planning phase have been resolved per maintainer ruling on 2026-09-02:

### OD-4: Tunnel in FR-012 Label Set

**Ruling (2026-09-02)**: **(a) include tunnel in the FR-012 label set**

Tunnel is the sixth optional component and MUST be tagged `[optional]` at first mention in each audited file, alongside sentinel, capture-sidecar, mcp-server, audit-syslog-bridge, and telemetry-receiver.

**Evidence**: CLAUDE.md:372 marks tunnel as `[optional] relay client supervisor`; SC-007 requires every optional feature in CLAUDE.md to be labelled.

### OD-9: CubeCoders AMP Verifiability

**Ruling (2026-09-02)**: **(b) fill only what is verifiable**

CubeCoders AMP cells that agents can verify from a fetchable official source are filled and dated. Every other CubeCoders cell reads: `not publicly documented (checked YYYY-MM-DD)` with the exact date implementation verified the source was unavailable.

**Evidence**: Section 7 Competitor Column updated with exact fallback text per this ruling.

### OD-10: 404 Dimension URLs — Fallback Sourcing

**Ruling (2026-09-02)**: **(b) hunt for the correct URL**

For the 404 Pterodactyl and Agones dimension pages, implementation searches the sites and archive.org for the moved page. If found, the source entry cites the found URL. If not found after documented hunt, the cell uses exact text: `source URL unavailable (checked YYYY-MM-DD)` with the date of the hunt.

**Evidence**: Section 9 docs/comparison-sources.md updated with fallback sourcing procedure per this ruling.

### OD-11: Agones Scope and N/A Cells

**Ruling (2026-09-02)**: **(b) keep Agones; non-mapping dimensions read "not applicable"**

Keep Agones in the table. For dimensions where Agones (a Kubernetes operator library, not a control panel) does not apply, mark the cell with exact text: `not applicable (Agones is a Kubernetes operator library)` [A-<row>].

**Evidence**: Dimensions typically N/A for Agones: Access control & authentication, Game template distribution, Backup and restore. Section 7 Competitor Column updated with exact N/A text per this ruling.

### OD-12: Agones Notation and Table Intro

**Ruling (2026-09-02)**: **(b) intro paragraph + README order: intro -> FR-004 status line -> table**

README placement order: intro paragraph above table explaining scope, then FR-004 status line, then comparison table. Intro paragraph states:

> Gameplane is compared to Pterodactyl and CubeCoders AMP (both control panels) and Agones (a Kubernetes operator library). While not direct competitors, Agones is included as a reference point for teams building on Kubernetes primitives.

**Evidence**: Section 2 added to this contract with intro paragraph requirement per this ruling. Section 11 acceptance checklist updated with intro paragraph verification step.

---

## 14. Notes for Implementation

1. **Intro paragraph placement**: The comparison table in README.md MUST be preceded by the intro paragraph (Section 2) explaining scope and category differences. Placement order: intro -> FR-004 status line -> table. Verify this placement before merge.

2. **Placeholder filling**: During implementation, each `<to be researched during implementation; source required>` placeholder MUST be replaced with actual verified content from official sources, dated and linked.

3. **CubeCoders research (OD-9)**: For CubeCoders AMP cells where official sources are not fetchable, use exact text: `not publicly documented (checked YYYY-MM-DD)` [C-<row>]. Record the date of the failed research attempt in docs/comparison-sources.md.

4. **404 fallback sourcing (OD-10)**: For Pterodactyl or Agones dimensions returning 404:
   - Hunt site + archive.org for the moved page
   - If found, cite the found URL in docs/comparison-sources.md
   - If not found, use exact text: `source URL unavailable (checked YYYY-MM-DD)` [<ABBREV>-<row>]
   - Record hunt results (dates, sites searched) in docs/comparison-sources.md

5. **Agones non-applicable cells (OD-11)**: For dimensions where Agones (Kubernetes library) does not apply, use exact text: `not applicable (Agones is a Kubernetes operator library)` [A-<row>]. Typical N/A dimensions: Access control & authentication, Game template distribution, Backup and restore. Verify each dimension before marking N/A.

6. **Tunnel in optional components (OD-4)**: When auditing docs, mark tunnel (relay supervisor) with `[optional]` tag at first mention, alongside sentinel, capture-sidecar, mcp-server, audit-syslog-bridge, and telemetry-receiver. Six total optional components per FR-012.

7. **Link validation**: Before merging, verify that all `[G-*]`, `[P-*]`, `[C-*]`, `[A-*]` markers in README resolve correctly to `docs/comparison-sources.md` anchors.

8. **Version freshness**: The Gameplane column uses v0.2.0-beta.8 facts verified on 2026-09-01. If a new release ships during implementation, re-verify the Gameplane column against the new appVersion.
