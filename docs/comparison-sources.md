## Pterodactyl

**License**: MIT  
**Documentation Root**: https://pterodactyl.io/  
**Repository**: https://github.com/pterodactyl/panel; https://github.com/pterodactyl/wings

<a id="pterodactyl-row-a"></a>
### Row (a): Deployment/runtime model

**Source ID**: P-a  
**URL**: https://pterodactyl.io/panel/1.0/getting_started.html; https://pterodactyl.io/project/introduction.html  
**Checked on**: 2026-09-02  
**What was verified**: Documentation states Panel is designed for self-hosted deployment on your own web server with multiple dependencies (web server, PHP, MySQL/MariaDB, Redis, systemd worker). Wings is "the next generation server control plane" written in Go, managing Docker containers. Panel and Wings are separate repositories working together: Panel is the user-facing management interface; Wings is the backend control system.  
**Last-known URL**: https://pterodactyl.io/ (docs root)

<a id="pterodactyl-row-b"></a>
### Row (b): Scaling & auto-sleep

**Source ID**: P-b  
**URL**: https://pterodactyl.io/community/config/nodes/add_node.html; https://pterodactyl.io/community/tutorials/artisan.html  
**Checked on**: 2026-09-02  
**What was verified**: Node documentation shows Pterodactyl supports multiple nodes with configurable total memory/disk and overallocation percentages. Artisan CLI includes `p:server:bulk-power` command for start/stop/kill/restart across servers/nodes. Search results describe cron-based scheduling for power actions and automatic restarts, but no dedicated idle/auto-sleep feature is documented. Schedules fire tasks at defined cron intervals.  
**Last-known URL**: https://pterodactyl.io/panel/1.0/ (panel docs entry)  
**Hunt**: Attempted https://pterodactyl.io/panel/1.0/scaling.html (returned 404 on 2026-09-02); scaling information sourced from node management and architecture docs.

### Row (c): Inbound connectivity (NAT traversal, relay)

**Source ID**: P-c  
**URL**: https://pterodactyl.io/wings/1.0/installing.html  
**Checked on**: 2026-09-02  
**What was verified**: Wings documentation discusses NAT considerations (internal IP used for systems behind NAT, localhost refers to container not node). Minecraft documentation mentions proxy server setup. Rathole (a reverse proxy for NAT traversal written in Rust) is listed as an available egg in eggs.pterodactyl.io but is not an integrated feature—users must deploy and configure it themselves. No integrated relay sidecars (frp, Tailscale, playit) found in official documentation.  
**Last-known URL**: https://pterodactyl.io/wings/1.0/ (wings docs root)

<a id="pterodactyl-row-d"></a>
### Row (d): Backup and restore

**Source ID**: P-d  
**URL**: https://pterodactyl.io/panel/1.0/additional_configuration.html  
**Checked on**: 2026-09-02  
**What was verified**: Panel documentation states Pterodactyl allows users to create server backups. Two storage drivers are supported: Wings (local, default: `APP_BACKUP_DRIVER=wings`) and S3-compatible (AWS S3 or compatible). Multipart upload is supported for S3. Users can create backups on-demand and via cron-based schedules. Existing backups remain accessible after switching storage methods (if S3 credentials are retained). Restore is performed through the panel interface.  
**Last-known URL**: https://pterodactyl.io/panel/1.0/ (panel docs root)

<a id="pterodactyl-row-e"></a>
### Row (e): Access control & authentication

**Source ID**: P-e  
**URL**: https://pterodactyl.io/panel/1.0/additional_configuration.html; https://pterodactyl.io/community/tutorials/artisan.html  
**Checked on**: 2026-09-02  
**What was verified**: Panel documentation shows 2FA toggle to require 2FA for all accounts or admin-only; can be disabled via Artisan CLI (`p:user:disable2fa`). APP_KEY is used as encryption key for API keys and other secure data. Artisan CLI includes user creation and deletion commands. Subusers are referenced in search results but no dedicated permissions documentation page was located on pterodactyl.io. Custom roles or granular permission system not documented.  
**Last-known URL**: https://pterodactyl.io/panel/1.0/ (panel docs root)  
**Hunt**: Searches for "Pterodactyl subusers permissions" and "Pterodactyl 2FA API keys" did not return dedicated authentication documentation pages; user management via Artisan CLI is documented; panel UI permission features not explicitly detailed.

**Source ID**: P-g  
**URL**: https://pterodactyl.io/community/config/nodes/add_node.html; https://pterodactyl.io/project/terms.html  
**Checked on**: 2026-09-02  
**What was verified**: Terminology defines Node as "physical machine running Wings instance"; Servers are "created on nodes, you can have multiple servers per node." Node configuration guide shows adding nodes to a Panel through admin interface with FQDN, daemon port, resource allocation. Documentation describes single Panel managing multiple nodes but does not document remote cluster functionality or cross-node console/log streaming. Architecture suggests single-panel, multi-node within one administrative domain.  
**Last-known URL**: https://pterodactyl.io/panel/1.0/ (panel docs root)  
**Hunt**: Attempted https://pterodactyl.io/panel/1.0/architecture.html (returned 404 on 2026-09-02); multi-node information available from node management and terminology docs.

**Checked on**: 2026-09-02  
**What was verified**: not publicly documented (checked 2026-09-02). Support forums contain discussions of manual port forwarding and remote connectivity setup; no official documentation found stating whether AMP includes built-in relay tunnels or automatic port mapping features.  
**Last-known URL**: https://www.cubecoders.com/AMP

<a id="cubecoders-row-d"></a>
### Row (d): Backup and restore

**Source ID**: C-d  
**URL**: https://discourse.cubecoders.com/t/how-do-i-do-a-backup-and-restore-with-amp/11937  
**Checked on**: 2026-09-02  
**What was verified**: not publicly documented (checked 2026-09-02). Discourse topic 11937 ("how do I do a backup and restore with AMP") is a user question that received no staff reply and auto-closed 30 days after posting ("This topic was automatically closed 30 days after the last reply. New replies are no longer allowed."); topic 2865 discusses restoring backups across server configurations but is likewise not an official CubeCoders statement. Per the user-question-thread sourcing rule, this falls back to the standard "not publicly documented" text — no official documentation confirms backup/restore as a supported feature.  
**Last-known URL**: https://www.cubecoders.com/AMP

<a id="cubecoders-row-e"></a>
### Row (e): Access control & authentication

**Source ID**: C-e  
**URL**: https://discourse.cubecoders.com/t/editions-comparison-sheet/2247, https://discourse.cubecoders.com/t/managing-user-permissions-in-amp/2301  
**Checked on**: 2026-09-02  
**What was verified**: Official editions comparison (topic 2247) states Advanced Edition includes "OIDC single-sign-on" and unlimited panel users. Managing permissions documentation (topic 2301) confirms role-based access control system. Search results indicate OIDC support is a distinguishing feature (first mainstream panel to support it per first search).

<a id="cubecoders-row-f"></a>
### Row (f): Game template distribution

**Source ID**: C-f  
**URL**: https://discourse.cubecoders.com/t/server-templates/4109, https://discourse.cubecoders.com/t/export-amp-template/23661  
**Checked on**: 2026-09-02  
**What was verified**: Support forum discussions confirm AMP has server templates for dozens of games (Rust, Minecraft, Arma Reforger, Satisfactory, Assetto Corsa, and others) built on a Generic module framework. CubeCoders staff (Greelan, topic 23661) state that built-in modules such as the default Rust module are "closed source" with "no 'template'" to export; Greelan separately maintains an open-source, Carbon-enabled Rust template in a public repository (`Greelan/AMPTemplates:dev`) that users can add through AMP's configuration system. Built-in templates are therefore not exportable — only separately hosted, community-contributed templates are.

### Row (g): Multi-tenancy & multi-cluster

**Source ID**: C-g  
**URL**: https://discourse.cubecoders.com/t/multi-tenant-hosting-per-user-instance-limits-resource-quotas-in-amp/40891, https://discourse.cubecoders.com/t/multiple-worker-amp-servers/12437  
**Checked on**: 2026-09-02  
**What was verified**: CubeCoders staff (Mike, discourse topic 40891, June 2026) explicitly state: "AMP 2 doesn't support the kind of multi-tenancy you describe, that is something that's coming to AMP 3." Controller architecture supports managing instances across separate physical servers (topic 12437), but per-user instance visibility/isolation is not a built-in AMP 2 capability — shared-usage deployments are described as typically relying on external billing/access providers (e.g. WHMCS) rather than a native multi-tenancy feature. No mention of cross-cluster console/log streaming found.

<a id="cubecoders-row-h"></a>
### Row (h): Licensing

**Source ID**: C-h  
**URL**: https://discourse.cubecoders.com/t/editions-comparison-sheet/2247  
**Checked on**: 2026-09-02  
**What was verified**: Official editions comparison topic (2247) confirms pricing in GBP and USD for four tiers (Standard/Professional/Advanced/Enterprise) with corresponding instance limits; licenses are issued per-instance. https://cubecoders.com/AMPTermsOfSale was independently re-fetched on 2026-09-02 and renders no text content (JS-only page; shows only "CubeCoders" and "Loading..."), so it cannot serve as a source per the licensing-cell sourcing rule — the word "subscription" is not asserted anywhere in this row.

## Agones

**License**: Apache License 2.0  
**Documentation Root**: https://agones.dev/site/docs/  
**Repository**: https://github.com/agones-dev/agones

<a id="agones-row-a"></a>
### Row (a): Deployment/runtime model

**Source ID**: A-a  
**URL**: https://agones.dev/site/docs/reference/fleet/  
**Checked on**: 2026-09-02  
**What was verified**: Agones is built as a Kubernetes-native library extending Kubernetes with GameServer and Fleet CRDs. Installation documentation confirms deployment across GKE (Google Kubernetes Engine), EKS (Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service), AKS (Azure Kubernetes Service), and OKE (Oracle Kubernetes Engine), as well as on-premises and local clusters.  
**Last-known URL**: https://agones.dev/site/docs/reference/fleet/

<a id="agones-row-b"></a>
### Row (b): Scaling & auto-sleep

**Source ID**: A-b  
**URL**: https://agones.dev/site/docs/advanced/scheduling-and-autoscaling/  
**Checked on**: 2026-09-02  
**What was verified**: Agones provides fleet autoscaling through buffer-based strategy (maintaining ready server pools) and webhook-driven strategy (custom autoscaling logic). Advanced feature (Beta) includes CounterPolicy and SchedulePolicy for prioritization during allocation. GameServer state documentation shows states (Ready, Allocated, Reserved, Unhealthy) but no idle or sleep state. Scale-down removes servers from the cluster rather than suspending them.  
**Last-known URL**: https://agones.dev/site/docs/advanced/scheduling-and-autoscaling/

<a id="agones-row-c"></a>
### Row (c): Inbound connectivity (NAT traversal, relay)

**Source ID**: A-c  
**URL**: https://agones.dev/site/docs/reference/gameserver/  
**Checked on**: 2026-09-02  
**What was verified**: GameServer Specification defines port policies: Dynamic (random free hostPort), Static (user-defined port), and Passthrough (containerPort equals hostPort). HostPort routing is implemented via iptables/ipvs kernel routing. No relay or NAT traversal features are documented in the official Agones documentation across Overview, Guides, Advanced topics, or Reference sections.  
**Last-known URL**: https://agones.dev/site/docs/reference/gameserver/

<a id="agones-row-d"></a>
### Row (d): Backup and restore

**Source ID**: A-d  
**URL**: source URL unavailable (checked 2026-09-02)  
**Checked on**: 2026-09-02  
**What was verified**: Agones documentation covers Installation, Getting Started, Guides (SDKs, health checking, metrics), Integration Patterns, Advanced Topics (scheduling, multi-cluster allocation, allocator service), and Reference (CRDs). No documentation section addresses game server backup, snapshots, or restore capabilities. Agones manages GameServer lifecycle (Ready, Allocated, Reserved, Unhealthy, Terminating states) but does not provide persistent state backup or recovery mechanisms. Not applicable: Agones is a Kubernetes operator library orchestrating ephemeral game server instances; persistent state management (if needed) is the responsibility of the game server application and its own storage integration.  
**Last-known URL**: none

<a id="agones-row-e"></a>
### Row (e): Access control & authentication

**Source ID**: A-e  
**URL**: https://agones.dev/site/docs/advanced/allocator-service/  
**Checked on**: 2026-09-02  
**What was verified**: Agones provides no dashboard or user management system. The allocator service (gRPC and REST API for external game server allocation) uses mutual TLS (mTLS) certificate-based authentication between clusters, not user dashboard authentication. Kubernetes RBAC controls API access to GameServer and Fleet CRDs for cluster operators. Not applicable: Agones is a Kubernetes operator library; access control is achieved through Kubernetes RBAC and infrastructure credentials (certificates, keys), not user authentication.  
**Last-known URL**: https://agones.dev/site/docs/advanced/allocator-service/

<a id="agones-row-f"></a>
### Row (f): Game template distribution

**Source ID**: A-f  
**URL**: source URL unavailable (checked 2026-09-02)  
**Checked on**: 2026-09-02  
**What was verified**: Agones documentation covers GameServer/Fleet CRD specifications, client SDKs for game server lifecycle management, deployment on various cloud providers and on-premises, fleet management, autoscaling, multi-cluster allocation, health checking, metrics, and high availability. No module system, template distribution mechanism, or game template registry exists. Agones operates at the infrastructure layer (orchestrating containerized game server instances) and does not provide a game template or module distribution system. Not applicable: Agones is a Kubernetes operator library, not a control panel with game distribution features.  
**Last-known URL**: none

### Row (g): Multi-tenancy & multi-cluster

**Source ID**: A-g  
**URL**: https://agones.dev/site/docs/advanced/multi-cluster-allocation/  
**Checked on**: 2026-09-02  
**What was verified**: Agones supports multi-cluster allocation using GameServerAllocationPolicy CRD which defines redirect rules and cluster priorities. Game servers are allocated from clusters with the lowest priority number; if unavailable, allocation routes to the next-lowest priority cluster. Clusters communicate via the agones-allocator service (gRPC and REST) authenticated with mutual TLS certificates and encryption (Kubernetes secrets store `allocator-tls`, `allocator-client-ca`, and optional `allocator-tls-ca`). Modern recommendation (per documentation) is to use a Service Mesh (Istio, Linkerd) for more powerful multi-cluster routing.
