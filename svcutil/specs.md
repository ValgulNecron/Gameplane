# svcutil — Specification

**Status:** Stable  
**Module / command:** `github.com/ValgulNecron/gameplane/svcutil`  
**Dependencies:** stdlib only (Go 1.26+)

## Purpose

Shared stdlib-only service helpers for environment parsing and graceful HTTP server shutdown. Reduces code duplication and enforces consistent startup and shutdown behavior across operator, api, agent, audit-syslog-bridge, and telemetry-receiver. All functions degrade gracefully on invalid inputs; no startup crashes from bad configuration.

## Responsibilities

- Parse environment variables with fallback semantics, distinguishing unset from empty-but-set.
- Parse log-level strings to `slog.Level` enums with case-insensitive recognition and graceful default on unknown values.
- Parse integer-valued environment variables with non-crashing fallback to defaults.
- Start HTTP servers and manage graceful shutdown on context cancellation with bounded timeout.
- Map shutdown success (`http.ErrServerClosed`) to nil so callers see clean completion.

## Non-goals / boundaries

- Does not provide configuration file parsing; only environment-variable and command-line inputs.
- Does not enforce configuration schema or validation; callers own business-logic constraints.
- Does not handle signal forwarding; callers that need signal → context.Done bridging use `signal.NotifyContext`.
- Does not manage connection pooling or middleware; `RunHTTP` runs a stock `http.Server` as-is.

### Exported Functions

| Function | Signature | Behavior |
|---|---|---|
| **`Or`** | `Or(key, fallback string) string` | Returns environment variable `key` if set (via `os.LookupEnv`); otherwise returns `fallback`. Distinguishes unset from empty-but-set: empty string in env returns `""`, not `fallback`. |
| **`OrInt`** | `OrInt(key string, def int) int` | Parses environment variable `key` as int via `strconv.Atoi`; returns `def` if unset or unparseable. Non-crashing: invalid values degrade to default rather than panicking. |
| **`ParseLogLevel`** | `ParseLogLevel(s string) slog.Level` | Maps case-insensitive log-level string to `slog.Level`. Recognized case-insensitively: debug, warn, error; anything else (including "info" or empty) defaults to `slog.LevelInfo`. Non-crashing fallback semantics. |
| **`RunHTTP`** | `RunHTTP(ctx context.Context, srv *http.Server, shutdownTimeout time.Duration) error` | Starts HTTP server; on context cancellation, performs graceful shutdown with deadline bounded by `shutdownTimeout`. Maps `http.ErrServerClosed` to `nil`. Returns listen error immediately or shutdown result on cancellation. |

## Key invariants

1. **Graceful fallback.** `OrInt` and `ParseLogLevel` never panic on invalid input; they degrade to sensible defaults (`def` for OrInt, `slog.LevelInfo` for ParseLogLevel). This is a guarantee: invalid manifest values must not crash the service at startup.

2. **Empty-string semantics.** `Or` distinguishes unset (`os.LookupEnv` returns `ok=false`) from empty-but-set (`os.LookupEnv` returns `v=""` with `ok=true`). Unset uses fallback; empty-but-set returns empty string (no fallback). This preserves user intent when an env var is intentionally cleared.

3. **Bounded shutdown.** `RunHTTP` calls `srv.Shutdown` with a deadline-bounded context derived from `shutdownTimeout`. If the timeout expires before all connections close, `srv.Shutdown` returns with a deadline-exceeded error and `RunHTTP` exits promptly. However, in-flight handlers continue running until they naturally complete or the process exits; the timeout bounds only how long `RunHTTP` waits, not handler execution. This prevents indefinite hangs in `RunHTTP` itself while preserving handler cleanup.

4. **Success mapping.** `RunHTTP` explicitly maps `http.ErrServerClosed` (the success path from `srv.Shutdown`) to `nil`, so callers see nil on clean shutdown and a non-nil error only on failure.

5. **Context propagation.** `RunHTTP` selects on both listen errors (returned immediately) and context cancellation (triggers shutdown). If the context is pre-cancelled or becomes cancelled before the server listens, shutdown proceeds normally.

## Dependencies

**Internal:** None.  
**External:** stdlib only (`context`, `errors`, `log/slog`, `net/http`, `os`, `strconv`, `strings`, `time`). No external modules in `go.mod`.

## Security considerations

- **No secrets in env vars.** This package reads environment variables for configuration only; credentials or sensitive values must be injected via files or mounts, not environment variables (which are visible in process listings and pod describe).
- **Graceful defaults prevent misconfiguration crashes.** Services that fail to start due to invalid log levels or port numbers in the environment are difficult to debug in containerized environments. Non-crashing fallbacks reduce incident severity (service starts, logs at info level, operator can adjust).
- **Bounded shutdown prevents hanging.** A service hung in shutdown — with `RunHTTP` waiting indefinitely for in-flight requests to close — can leave resources locked or cause deployment failures. `shutdownTimeout` bounds how long `RunHTTP` waits; Kubernetes `terminationGracePeriodSeconds` (usually 30 seconds) provides the outermost bound. Handlers themselves are not force-terminated by this timeout and may continue running after `RunHTTP` returns.

## Testing & coverage

**Test structure:**
- Unit tests in `env_test.go` cover `Or`, `OrInt`, `ParseLogLevel` with table-driven cases for set/unset/invalid/empty/default scenarios.
- Unit tests in `server_test.go` cover `RunHTTP` lifecycle:
  - `TestRunHTTPCleanShutdown`: clean context cancellation and graceful shutdown.
  - `TestRunHTTPListenError`: immediate return on listen errors.
  - `TestRunHTTPContextCancelledBeforeListen`: pre-cancelled context triggers shutdown.
  - `TestRunHTTPServerClosedError`: verification that `http.ErrServerClosed` is not returned to callers.
  - `TestRunHTTPShutdownTimeout`: shutdown timeout mechanism bounds `RunHTTP`'s wait time.

**Coverage gate:** 90% (`.testcoverage.yml`, total threshold).

**Uncovered paths:** The small 10% gap accounts for the following shutdown edge case:
- Shutdown returning context.DeadlineExceeded because a handler is still active past the deadline: no test currently holds a request open past the timeout to verify that `RunHTTP` returns the deadline error while the handler continues running. This path is difficult to test reliably without introducing flaky timing assumptions.

These edge cases are acceptable because:
1. They occur only during service shutdown/restart, not during steady-state operation.
2. The outer Kubernetes `terminationGracePeriodSeconds` ensures eventual termination even if shutdown races occur.
3. Triggering them in a test would require flaky timing assumptions or mocking system calls.

**Key test cases:**
- **Environment parsing:** Unset, set, empty, invalid values; fallback semantics; case-insensitivity.
- **Server lifecycle:** Clean shutdown, listen error, pre-cancelled context, shutdown timeout, ErrServerClosed mapping.
