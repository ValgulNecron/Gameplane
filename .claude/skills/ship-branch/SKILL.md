## Push & Watch CI

1. Ensure the branch is signed and all commits have the full trailer:
   ```
   Co-Authored-By: <model actually running this session> <noreply@anthropic.com>
   Claude-Session: https://claude.ai/code/session_<id>
   ```
   
   The Co-Authored-By name MUST be the model actually running — never a value copied from CLAUDE.md, this skill, or a prior commit.

2. Push the feature branch (never to `master`):
   ```sh
   git push -u origin <branch-name>
   ```

3. Watch the CI run on GitHub Actions. The suite must **pass on CI**, not locally (rule 8):
   ```sh
   gh run watch
   # or for a specific run:
   gh run view <run-id> --watch
   ```

4. If CI fails, fix the issue and create a **new commit** (never amend):
   ```sh
   git commit -s -m "fix: <scope> - <description>"
   git push
   ```
   - The new commit re-triggers CI automatically.
   - Repeat until the branch is green.

5. **Do not request review until CI is green.** Rule 12 / `dismiss_stale_reviews_on_push` means any later commits **drop an approval** — get the branch fully passing before asking.

## Create the PR

6. Open the PR:
   ```sh
   gh pr create --title "brief title (under 70 chars)" --body "$(cat <<'EOF'
   ## Summary
   - Change 1
   - Change 2

   ## Test plan
   - [ ] Manual test step 1
   - [ ] Manual test step 2

   🤖 Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code)

   EOF
   )"
   ```

7. **Mandatory labels** (rule 14) — at least one `type:` and one `area:`, plus `breaking` if applicable:

   **Add labels via REST API** (rule 14: `gh pr edit` is broken on this repo):
   ```sh
   # Example: type:fix + area:api
   gh api -X POST repos/ValgulNecron/Gameplane/issues/<PR_NUMBER>/labels \
     -f "labels[]=type: fix" \
     -f "labels[]=area: api"
   ```

   **Type labels** (pick one): `feature`, `fix`, `refactor`, `test`, `ci`, `chore`, `docs`, `security`

   **Area labels** (pick one or more): `operator`, `api`, `agent`, `web`, `modules`, `chart`, `e2e`, `specs`, `shared`, `optional-components`

   **Special labels** (if applicable): `breaking` (for CRD/API/chart changes)

8. Verify labels were applied:
   ```sh
   gh api repos/ValgulNecron/Gameplane/issues/<PR_NUMBER>/labels \
     -q '[.[].name]|join(", ")'
   ```

## Await Maintainer Merge

9. The PR is now blocked waiting on the maintainer (rule 12: `required_approving_review_count: 1` and self-approval is impossible). Do not use `gh pr merge --admin` or any other bypass.

10. Watch for the maintainer's approval and merge. Once merged:

## Clean Up After Merge

11. Delete the remote branch:
    ```sh
    git push origin --delete <branch-name>
    ```

12. Delete the local branch:
    ```sh
    git branch -d <branch-name>
    ```

13. **Do not delete unmerged branches** or stacked children whose descendants still depend on them (merge bottom-up first).

## Notes

- **Master is protected** by a ruleset (rule 12): direct pushes refused, requires approval, dismisses stale reviews on later pushes.
- **Codegen output** (e.g., CRD regenerates per rule 7) goes in the same commit as the source change that triggered it.
- **Breaking changes** to CRDs, API, or the Helm chart require the `breaking` label (rule 14).
- **Session URL**: both the PR body footer and the commit trailer must cite the session that produced the work.
