## Rule 1 & 2 compliance: design exports

Every edit to `design.pen` (dashboard) or `website/website.pen` (public site) must be followed by incremental export of only the touched nodes. Never hand-edit `.pen` files; all access via the `pencil` MCP server.

### When to run this skill

- After editing any screen or component in `design.pen` or `website/website.pen` via the Pencil editor.
- Before committing the `.pen` change.
- As part of the same commit as the design change (export step is not a separate follow-up commit).

### Pre-export checklist

1. **Pencil does not auto-save.** After MCP edits (or any editor work), ask the user to save the design file via the GUI before proceeding with export.
2. **Collect touched node IDs.** Identify which screens and components were added or modified. Node IDs are visible in Pencil's node inspector or in the Get() output.
3. **Verify against MANIFEST.md.** Check `design-export/MANIFEST.md` to see whether any existing node needs its export refreshed (e.g., a re-exported variant of a screen).

### Export procedure

For each touched node ID:

1. **JSON export** — via `mcp__pencil__execute` running `Get("<id>", {depth: N})`:
   - Choose depth high enough that the node's complete structure comes through with zero `"..."` elision markers.
   - Pipe output to `design-export/json/<id>.json` (website screens → `website/website-export/json/<id>.json`).
   - Validation: `python3 -m json.tool <id>.json > /dev/null` must pass.

2. **Screenshot export** — via `mcp__pencil__export_nodes`:
   - Export the node ID at 2x scale.
   - Write to `design-export/screenshots/<id>.png` (website → `website/website-export/screenshots/<id>.png`).
   - Validation: file must be non-empty with real pixel dimensions.

3. **Content validation** — grep for a string unique to that node's body text (never in a frame name):
   - Screen text, component label, or dialog copy — something that only appears in that object's own design content.
   - Example: a new "Capture" screen must grep for `"not enabled"` (its body text), not `"Capture"` (which is in every capture-related frame's *name*).
   - All grep hits must come from the relevant `<id>.json` file, nowhere else in the export.

### Incremental export — touch only what changed

- Export only the nodes you added or edited — do NOT re-run a full export of every screen and component unless renames or structural changes make wider staleness likely.
- If a re-exported node is a variant of an existing screen (e.g., "Admin Settings — Authentication (Save rejected)"), add a row to `design-export/MANIFEST.md` under an "Incremental export" section documenting the date, nodes touched, what changed, and export method/validation used.
- Keep the MANIFEST always in git so the next session can see what was exported when and why.

### Same-commit rule

The export MUST land in the same commit as the `.pen` file change:

```sh
git add design.pen design-export/json/<id>.json design-export/screenshots/<id>.png design-export/MANIFEST.md
git commit -s -m "design: <brief description of change>"
```

Do NOT split into two commits (one for .pen, one for export).

### Lessons from prior passes

- **Keyword checks must match content, not frame names.** A grep for "Capture" passes even on a hollow JSON file if the frame is named `Screen/...Capture...` — grep for the screen's unique *body text* instead.
- **Depth matters.** If a JSON export still contains `"..."` elision markers, the depth was too shallow — re-export at a higher depth until zero elisions appear.
- **Verify after extract.** Subagents may self-report success (100% completion) while still corrupting output — always re-load() exported JSON files and verify dimension/pixel counts on PNGs.
- **`includePathGeometry: true` for sparklines/paths.** If the JSON file contains vector path nodes, use `{depth: N, includePathGeometry: true}` to avoid `"geometry": "..."` elisions.
