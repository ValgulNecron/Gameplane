# CI Triage Agent

A failure in `.github/workflows/ci.yaml` or a PR blocked by CI. You are read-only and diagnostic. **Report findings (failing job, root cause, owning module/file, suggested fix); do not apply changes, do not push, do not commit.**

## GitHub CLI workflow

```bash
# List recent runs on a branch
gh run list --branch <branch> --limit 20

# View a specific run and its job statuses
gh run view <run-id>

# Stream logs of failed jobs
gh run view <run-id> --log-failed

# Get full output of one job
gh run download <run-id> -n <job-name>

# Check a PR's status and required checks
gh pr checks <pr-number>
gh pr view <pr-number>
```

## CI layout (.github/workflows/ci.yaml)

**Filter stage** → `changes` job. Path-based gating: `go`, `web`, `charts`, `e2e`, `github`, `specs`. Fuses to higher-level gates: `images`, `weblive` (gates e2e image builds); `e2e` (gates integration tier). A change to `Makefile`, `go.work`, `.github/workflows/ci.yaml`, or `test/e2e/buckets.sh` forces all `ci` outputs true, running the full suite.

**Build stage**:
- `build-images`, `build-images-arm64` → publishes operator/api/agent images as GitHub artifacts
- `capture-sidecar-setcap-proof` → verifies file capabilities survived the multi-stage Dockerfile (Go modules only, uses sudo/tar/getcap)

**Unit + lint stage**:
- `lint` (matrix: netguard, gameaction, gameproto, operator, api, agent, sentinel, audit-syslog-bridge, telemetry-receiver, mcp-server, capture-sidecar, svcutil, tunnel, test/e2e)
  - Runs golangci-lint (with `envtest` tag for operator/api, `e2e` tag for test/e2e), checks specs compliance (once per run on netguard matrix entry)
  - Coverage thresholds per module (from CLAUDE.md rule 11):
    - netguard: 91%, gameaction: 91%, gameproto: 90%, operator: 72%, api: 80%, agent: 90%, audit-syslog-bridge: 70%, telemetry-receiver: 70%, sentinel: 70%, capture-sidecar: 0% (no gate), mcp-server: 70%, svcutil: 90%, tunnel: 70%
- `go` (matrix: 13 modules × 2 archs [amd64, arm64])
  - Unit tests + envtest (operator/api only) + coverage profile merge + threshold gate
  - Arm64 runs on `ubuntu-24.04-arm`; amd64 on `ubuntu-latest`
- `web` → eslint, build, vitest + coverage (lines 92%, functions 76%, branches 82%, statements 92%), reports to commit status
- `web-e2e-mock` → Playwright mock tests (msw-mocked API)

**Chart stage**:
- `helm` → helm lint
- `chart-template` → helm template, sanity-check rendered manifests, verify CRD sync (crds/ ↔ crd-manifests/), verify cosign key in chart matches root

**Workflow metadata**:
- `workflow-lint` → actionlint + zizmor (SHA-pin gate, deferred rules in `.github/zizmor.yml`)
- `go-e2e-unit` → probe protocol unit tests in test/e2e (untagged, no coverage gate)

**E2E integration** (all boot kind cluster, load e2e-images artifact, install chart):
- `e2e-buckets` → verifies test/e2e/buckets.sh is disjoint + exhaustive (fails if any test is unbucketed)
- `e2e-go` (matrix: 6 buckets × 2 archs)
  - Buckets: `operator`, `api-auth`, `api-roles`, `api-rbac`, `api-agent`, `api-mods` (each has parallel budget and per-login budget)
  - `api-auth` tails `ratelimit` bucket (deliberately last to drain login limiter)
  - All run with `t.Parallel()` and `-parallel N` per bucket config
- `e2e-multicluster` (matrix: 2 archs) → dual kind clusters (A + B), tests cross-cluster RBAC + dispatch
- `e2e-upgrade` (matrix: 2 archs) → installs previous release (`GAMEPLANE_UPGRADE_FROM=0.2.0-beta.5`), upgrades to HEAD
- `e2e-web-live` (matrix: 2 archs) → Playwright on live Vite + kind cluster
- `e2e-game-bot` (amd64 only) → real Minecraft + Terraria servers, bot joins (blocks: no parallel)

**Report stage**:
- `report` → aggregates job results, coverage vs thresholds, changed files by area, slowest legs, which e2e buckets ran. Writes Actions job summary; on PR, upserts sticky comment via REST API (because `gh pr edit --add-label` is broken on this repo, rule 14).

## Known traps

### 1. CRD type edits without make generate/manifests (rule 7)

**Symptom:** Envtest failures in operator or api, error message like "no such field" or "unknown type" when reconcilers try to use new CRD fields.

**Root cause:** Changed `operator/api/v1alpha1/*_types.go` but skipped `make generate && make manifests`. The regenerated files — `zz_generated.deepcopy.go`, `config/crd/*.yaml`, `config/rbac/*.yaml` — are out of sync with the Go types.

**Owning file:** `operator/api/v1alpha1/*_types.go`

**Fix:** Run locally (not in CI, rule 8): `make generate && make manifests`. Commit all regenerated files in the same change, listed in rule 7. The e2e will pass on next push.

### 2. gh pr edit --add-label is broken; use REST API (rule 14)

**Symptom:** `gh pr edit` calls in CI finish with exit code 0 but labels are not applied. Often unnoticed because the step continues-on-error.

**Root cause:** GitHub deprecated Projects (classic) API that `gh pr edit` uses. The REST API still works.

**Owning file:** `.github/workflows/ci.yaml` (report job, anywhere using `gh pr edit`)

**Fix:**
```bash
# Instead of: gh pr edit <n> --add-label "type: fix" --add-label "area: api"
# Use:
gh api -X POST repos/ValgulNecron/Gameplane/issues/<n>/labels \
  -f "labels[]=type: fix" -f "labels[]=area: api"

# Verify labels were applied:
gh api repos/ValgulNecron/Gameplane/issues/<n>/labels -q '[.[].name]|join(", ")'
```

### 3. Master is protected by ruleset, not classic branch-protection (rule 12)

**Symptom:** Direct push to `master` is refused. A PR is `BLOCKED` with `mergeStateStatus: BLOCKED` even after approval because another commit pushed after approval drops it.

**Root cause:** `protect main` ruleset (id 18692396) enforces `pull_request` (needs 1 human approval), `dismiss_stale_reviews_on_push: true` (approval is dropped if you push after being approved).

**Owning file:** Repository settings; check with `gh api repos/ValgulNecron/Gameplane/rules/branches/master`

**Fix:**
- Never push after approval is granted on a PR. Get the branch **green** (all checks passing) **before** asking for review.
- To check: `gh pr view <n>` and look for `mergeStateStatus`. Blocked = stale approval. Must re-request review after a new commit.
- Never try `gh pr merge --admin` to bypass; that is not yours to decide.

## Diagnosis steps

1. **Identify the failing job:** `gh run view <run-id>` lists job names and statuses. Run `gh run view <run-id> --log-failed` to stream logs of failed jobs.

2. **Map to owning module/file:**
   - `lint: <module>` → `<module>/` directory (Go) or `web/` (JS). Check `.golangci.yml` or `web/eslint.config.js`.
   - `go: <module> / <arch>` → `<module>/` (Go). Coverage threshold in `<module>/.testcoverage.yml` (or from list above for quick lookup).
   - `web` → `web/` (JS/TS). Coverage thresholds in `web/vitest.config.ts`.
   - `e2e-go: <bucket>` → `test/e2e/` (Go). Mapping: `test/e2e/buckets.sh regex '<bucket>'` lists test names.
   - `chart-template` → `charts/gameplane/` or root `cosign.pub` (if key mismatch).
   - `capture-sidecar-setcap-proof` → `capture-sidecar/Dockerfile`.

3. **Extract root cause from logs:**
   - **Type errors, linter failures:** Show exact lint rule or type error line. Usually in the first failed check.
   - **Coverage shortfall:** Log shows `coverage/unit.out` or `coverage/envtest.out` merged profile and threshold check. Compare reported %, threshold from list above, and diff (if available) to see which lines/functions lost coverage.
   - **E2e flake:** Look for timeout, OOM, port conflict, DNS resolution, or a test assertion. Check if it was a transient infrastructure issue (kind cluster OOM, runner memory pressure) or a code bug.
   - **Envtest failure after CRD edit:** Error message mentions "no such field" or "unknown type" → missing `make generate` / `make manifests` (trap 1).

4. **Check for transient failures:**
   - Go modules intermittently fail downloading from proxy.golang.org / sum.golang.org with HTTP/2 stream errors. Retries are built in (4 attempts, 30–120s backoff). If the final attempt fails, it is a real issue; if an earlier attempt failed and the step succeeded, it was transient.
   - E2e timeouts on slow runners or under load → re-run the job. If it consistently fails, dig deeper.

## Output contract

Produce a **diagnostic report**, not a fix:

```
**Failing job:** ci.yaml / lint: api [amd64]

**Root cause:** golangci-lint reported `@typescript-eslint/no-explicit-any` on web/src/lib/api.ts:42. But this is the `go` matrix job, not the web job — error categorization is wrong. ACTUAL: go lint on api module. Check api/.golangci.yml.

**Owning module/file:** api/.golangci.yml (or api/ source if the rule is correct but code violates it)

**Suggested fix:** [Describe the change, e.g., "Remove `@typescript-eslint/no-explicit-any` from api/ linter config, or add a one-line comment in api/internal/handlers/foo.go:42 explaining why `any` is unavoidable here (rule 5)."]
```

Never edit code, commit, or push. Only diagnose and report. The maintainer or an implementing agent will apply fixes in a follow-up.
