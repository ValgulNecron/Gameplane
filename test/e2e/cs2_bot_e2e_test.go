// TestGameServer_CS2Bot_Query boots a REAL Counter-Strike 2 server
// (joedwards32/cs2 — the same image the shipped cs2 module uses) through
// the operator, waits for it to reach Running, then runs an in-cluster
// A2S protocol client to verify it reaches QUERY depth (server accepts A2S queries).
// The Source protocol handshake (Challenge + Connect) is attempted diagnostically
// but does not determine the depth, as the Source CONNECT format is unverified.
//
// CS2 is in the HEAVY game set — large disk requirements (60Gi as declared by vendor),
// multi-GB SteamCMD download (10–30 min+), and extended boot time. This test
// DELIBERATELY NEVER RUNS IN CI. It is validated only by maintainer hand-run with:
//
//	GAMEPLANE_E2E_REUSE_CLUSTER=1 GAMEPLANE_E2E_CONTEXT=<kubelab|prod> GAMEPLANE_E2E_GAMES=all make test-e2e-keep
//
// This test is runnable only on a cluster with at least 60Gb of free disk, as
// the vendor's joedwards32/cs2 image pulls multi-GB SteamCMD content into the
// declared PVC on first boot.
//
// The test uses a placeholder SRCDS_TOKEN (not a valid Valve credential), so
// the server will start and answer A2S queries. Real player connections would be
// rejected at the GSLT gate, but that is not tested here (PARTIAL depth).
//
// DO NOT mark as t.Parallel() — two real game servers booting concurrently
// OOM-starve a single kind node.
