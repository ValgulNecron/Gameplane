// TestGameServer_EnshroudedBot_Query boots a REAL Enshrouded server
// (mornedhels/enshrouded-server:1.7.2) through the operator, waits for it to reach Running,
// then runs a minimal probe inside the cluster to verify the query port responds.
//
// Enshrouded is part of the HEAVY set because it requires 25Gi of storage and significant
// boot time (world generation, etc.). The heavy set never runs in CI; it is opt-in only
// via GAMEPLANE_E2E_GAMES=all.
//
// The test is deliberately NOT t.Parallel(): concurrent real-game boots exhaust resources
// on a single kind node. The heavy set is hand-run on a real cluster (kubelab, prod, etc.)
// against an already-up cluster.
//
// DEPTH EXPECTATION: This test expects QUERY depth, proven by the query port (UDP 15637)
// responding to a probe packet. Enshrouded has no console, no RCON, and no remote command
// execution of any kind, so this is the only measurement surface available. The probe sends
// a minimal probe packet, logs the hex response (bounded to prevent log flooding), and returns
// QUERY if any response is received. If the port does not respond, the probe fails with a
// fatal error because there is no other path to measure.
