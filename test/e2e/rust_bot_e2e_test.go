// TestGameServer_RustBot_Query boots a REAL Rust server
// (didstopia/rust-server with sv_lan 1) through the operator, waits for it to reach Running,
// then runs a minimal A2S protocol bot inside the cluster to measure the join depth.
//
// Rust is part of the HEAVY game set — the didstopia/rust-server image performs
// multi-GB SteamCMD downloads on first boot and has extended initialization time.
// This test DELIBERATELY NEVER RUNS IN CI. It is validated only by maintainer hand-run with:
//
//	GAMEPLANE_E2E_REUSE_CLUSTER=1 GAMEPLANE_E2E_CONTEXT=<kubelab|prod> GAMEPLANE_E2E_GAMES=all make test-e2e-keep
//
// This test requires at least 10Gb of free disk (declared PVC size) and 10+ minutes
// wall-clock time for the Rust server to initialize and be ready for queries.
//
// The test uses sv_lan 1 to disable Steam GSLT requirement, allowing the server to start
// without valid Valve credentials. However, the Rust game protocol is RakNet-derived and
// undocumented, so real player joins would fail at the Steam auth gate. This probe measures
// QUERY depth only — the server answers A2S queries but does not accept real joins.
//
// DO NOT mark as t.Parallel() — two real game servers booting concurrently on a single
// kind node OOM-starve the allocator.
