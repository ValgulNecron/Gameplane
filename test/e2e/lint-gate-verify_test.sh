# Integration test for the lint-gate-verify verifier.
#
# This script runs the verifier against all fixtures and asserts:
# 1. Each fixture exits with code 1 (hard failure)
# 2. The error message matches the expected pattern for that check
# 3. The verifier exits 0 against the real repository root
#
# Exit codes:
#   0: All tests passed
#   1: One or more tests failed
#
# Usage:
#   test/e2e/lint-gate-verify_test.sh

# Deliberately NOT `set -e`: this is a test harness that must keep running
# after a fixture fails, so it can report every failure in one pass.
