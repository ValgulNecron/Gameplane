#
# Of the 10 rules in specs/done_004-lint-backlog-wave2/contracts/lint-gate.md,
# this script enforces R-001, R-002, R-003, R-004, R-006, R-008, R-009, and
# R-010 via line-oriented scans of ci.yaml (and go.work for R-001). R-005
# (exact-string `if:` matching) and R-007 (a new go.work member must add a
# matrix entry in the SAME PR) are deliberately out of scope: both need
# information this script does not have — R-005 needs a real expression
# parser to distinguish exact-string equality from regex/prefix matching
# rather than just grepping for the pattern that's already expected; R-007
# is a cross-commit/PR-history requirement, not something a single tree
# snapshot can observe. verify() prints a NOTE naming both on every run.
#
# Usage:
#   lint-gate-verify.sh [verify]     run all consistency checks (default)

# line and must stop at the NEXT job and nowhere else.
#
# A previous version of every scanner in this file used
# "^[[:space:]]*[a-z-]+:[[:space:]]*\$" — no anchor on the indentation at
# all — to mean "stop at the next job". That matches ANY bare key at ANY
# depth: "strategy:", "matrix:", "steps:", even "with:" nested three levels
# deep inside a step. Since the real lint job's very first line after
# "lint:" is "    strategy:" (a bare key one level in), every one of those
# scanners broke out of its loop before ever reaching "steps:", so every
# check silently stopped seeing real content and either failed for the
# wrong reason or (worse) failed on a config that is actually correct.
# Anchoring to the literal 2-space job indentation is the fix: nested keys
