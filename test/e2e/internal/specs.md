# e2e game-bot harness — Specification

**Status:** beta (v0.2.0-beta.8), in-progress (fast set JOINED, heavy set not yet implemented)  
**Module / package:** `test/e2e/internal/{probe,protocol,<game>}` — per-game protocol clients and the shared probe harness (plus `internal/fakeoidc`, an unrelated e2e fixture — see `test/e2e/api_auth_e2e_test.go`)  
**Dependencies:** stdlib only (Go 1.25+) — per-game binaries build against `test/e2e/go.mod` with `GOWORK=off`, dragging zero Kubernetes or external modules into the probe image

## Purpose

Prove that a Gameplane-managed game server is not merely "Running" in Kubernetes but genuinely playable: that it speaks its real game protocol, accepts players (or reaches the exact credential gate the test measures), and does so through the network path a real in-cluster client uses. Each game's headless protocol client (in `internal/<game>/app.go`) runs as a Job *inside* the cluster and dials the game Service directly, removing the `kubectl port-forward` hop and exercising authentic in-cluster networking.

This harness exists in two independent layers:

- **Path A** — through Gameplane — validates the full stack after Path B succeeds: API authentication, `/servers/{name}/actions/run` route, WebSocket log tailing, agent sidecar, and on down to the module's declared control protocol (RCON or stdin). Path A reuses the same running server from Path B rather than booting a second server; this proves the product works end-to-end without doubling boot time.
- **Path B** — the per-game client — proves the server itself is serving, independent of any Gameplane assumptions. It speaks the real game protocol, shares no code with the agent, and observes only the network facts: what does a real client see?

Neither path alone is sufficient. Path A alone self-confirms (our API talking to our agent); Path B is the ground truth that the server is actually working. Path A + Path B together prove the product works end-to-end.

## Responsibilities

**Path B (probe):**
1. Measure the exact join depth (JOINED, PARTIAL, or QUERY) each game's client reaches and assert it matches the expected depth.
2. Reject depth regressions: if a game measured as PARTIAL must fail if it starts JOINED (credential gate moved) or drops to QUERY (protocol access lost).
3. Provide a shared retry harness (`probe.Main`, `probe.Retry`) so every per-game binary avoids re-implementing deadline logic, retry loops, and depth validation.
4. Run per-game probes as Kubernetes Jobs inside the cluster (not via `kubectl port-forward`), using the same network path a real player uses.
5. Build one multi-game probe image (`gameplane-test/gameprobe`) with all per-game binaries at `/probe/<game>`.
6. Define the protocol specifications and shared family implementations (Source A2S, LiteNetLib, etc.) so new games reuse proven code.
7. Support environment-based gating (`GAMEPLANE_E2E_GAME_BOT`, `GAMEPLANE_E2E_GAMES`) so heavy games never run in CI.

**Path A (control channel):**
1. After Path B proves the server is running and reachable via its real protocol, exercise the module's declared control channel (RCON or stdin/PTY) through the Gameplane API.
2. For RCON games (Minecraft): POST `/servers/{name}/actions/run` with the `broadcast` action, passing a unique test message as a parameter, then tail `/ws/servers/{name}/logs` to observe the message in console output.
3. For stdin/PTY games (Terraria): POST the `broadcast` action with a unique test message, then tail logs to observe the message in console output.
4. For games with no control channel (Garry's Mod): skip Path A; document in the spec that no control surface is available.
5. Reuse the same running server from Path B rather than booting a second server; this proves the product works without doubling boot time and CI costs.
6. Assert the unique message appears in logs (not just the API response), proving the action actually reached the game process and produced observable output.

## Non-goals / boundaries

- Does not execute game-specific custom logic (mod installation, custom commands). Path A exercises those; Path B proves the server.
- Does not provide a general game-client SDK — each protocol is hand-rolled to exactly what CI can measure, not what the real game client needs.
- Does not attempt to reach the Play state or complete a full game session. Measuring login depth is the entire goal.
- Does not create game accounts or supply external credentials (Steam auth, EOS tokens, PlayFab keys). A PARTIAL depth is the boundary where CI cannot proceed.
- Does not instrument the Gameplane stack itself. Path B is *separate* from the operator, API, and agent code.

```

The `probe` package provides the harness; per-game `app.go` files (one per `internal/<game>/`) build to `/probe/<game>` via the Dockerfile's GOWORK=off build. Each `internal/<game>/spec.md` documents the measured depth and protocol reference. Shared families live once in `protocol/<family>/` with their own spec and unit tests; per-game `protocol/` dirs hold only game-specific deviations (version pins, packet subsets, quirks).

## External interface / contracts

## JoinDepth contract

The `joindepth.JoinDepth` type represents the exact point a probe reached in a game's join handshake.

**Three values, in strict ordering:**

- **`QUERY`** — out-of-band reachability only. Proved via status query (A2S_INFO, RCON dial, bare socket dial), not a real join handshake. Exit 0 only if server was unreachable (under `-expect-fail`).
- **`PARTIAL`** — server accepted the client's join handshake intent and the exchange proceeded, but was deliberately not completed (e.g., sentinel wake-on-connect tests). No post-join artifact from the server.
- **`JOINED`** — client completed the full protocol login/join handshake and observed a server-originated post-join artifact proving it (e.g., Minecraft Login Success packet, Terraria WorldData frame). **Only JOINED constitutes join coverage per FR-006.**

**Stable wire encoding:** uppercase string names `"QUERY"`, `"PARTIAL"`, `"JOINED"`, used in the probe CLI contract and VERDICT lines.

**Invariant:** Tests assert an *exact* expected depth. An unexpected upgrade (e.g., test expects QUERY but probe reached JOINED) is a failure signal — it indicates a correctness defect that must be investigated before the depth measurement is updated.

**Ordering:** `QUERY < PARTIAL < JOINED`. The `joindepth` package provides `Less`, `LessOrEqual`, `Greater`, `GreaterOrEqual` comparators.

### Shared harness (`probe` package)

**`Depth` type** — how far into a real join a client got:

```go
type Depth string

const (
    Joined  Depth = "JOINED"  // server accepted the client as a player; login succeeded
    Partial Depth = "PARTIAL" // spoke the real protocol, then hit a credential gate CI cannot mint
    Query   Depth = "QUERY"   // even a partial join is impossible; only the query/status protocol works
)
```

## ProbeVerdict wire format

A probe binary emits a machine-readable **`VERDICT`** line on stdout that the test harness parses to distinguish exit code meanings. The format is:

```
VERDICT	<result>	<depth>	<depth_evidence>
```

Tab-separated fields:

1. **`result`** — classification: `PASS`, `FAIL_WRONG_DEPTH`, `FAIL_TRANSPORT`, `FAIL_INTERNAL_ERROR`, or `FAIL_NEGATIVE_CONTROL_REACHED`.
2. **`depth`** — the reached depth: `QUERY`, `PARTIAL`, or `JOINED` (or `UNKNOWN` if no transport).
3. **`depth_evidence`** — human-readable name of the server-originated artifact proving the depth.

**Invariant for JOINED:** The `depth_evidence` field **must** name the server-originated artifact (e.g., "login success for user bot#1", "WorldData frame received"). A JOINED depth without evidence is invalid.

For PARTIAL and QUERY, evidence is recommended for debugging but optional.

The `joindepth.ProbeVerdict` struct holds the structured result; `Encode()` produces the VERDICT line, and `ParseVerdict()` consumes it.

### Exit-code semantics and the critical 2 vs 3 distinction

Exit codes map probe outcomes to POSIX semantics:

- **`0`** — success: probe reached the expected depth (or, under `-expect-fail`, correctly failed to reach it).
- **`1`** — probe internal error: bad flags, panic, misconfiguration, or unusable environment.
- **`2`** — connected to a live listener but reached the wrong depth. Protocol layer is broken, or handshake failed partway.
- **`3`** — transport failure: nothing listening, connection refused, DNS failure, timeout, or no bytes exchanged.

**Why 2 and 3 must stay distinguishable:** The automatic negative control (see below) asserts *specifically on exit code 3*. It proves the probe can fail when the address is genuinely unreachable. If a probe that has a bug elsewhere (e.g., its protocol parsing) still manages to reject a dead address, it will return 3 when run against `127.0.0.1:1`. But if the probe is broken in a way that prevents it from ever reaching any server (e.g., a malformed Dial), it will return 1 (internal error). Collapsing 2 and 3 into a single "failure" code would allow a probe with an unrelated bug to pass the negative control for the wrong reason — it would return what looks like "no server" (old code 2/3 bundle) when it actually means "probe has a bug that happens to look like transport failure".

The test harness reads the exit code and the VERDICT line to distinguish these cases; see `verifyNegativeControlTransportFailure` in `gamebot_helpers_e2e_test.go`.

### Automatic negative control: structural guarantee for FR-002

Every game-bot test runs an **automatic negative control** immediately after the positive control. This proves the probe can fail when it must. The flow (in `runGameBotTest` and `runGameBotNegativeControl`):

1. **Positive control** — run the probe against the real game Service; expect exit 0 and depth matching `ExpectDepth`.
2. **Negative control** — run the *same* probe against `127.0.0.1:1` (a reliably closed address, port 1 is reserved and never listens) with the `-expect-fail` flag.
   - Under `-expect-fail`, the probe inverts its logic: it exits 0 if it *fails* to reach `ExpectDepth` (the expected behavior when the address is unreachable).
   - The probe must exit 3 (transport failure), not 1 (internal error) or 2 (wrong depth).
   - The test calls `verifyNegativeControlTransportFailure()` to parse the VERDICT line and assert that `depth == UNKNOWN` — no protocol depth was measured because the connection failed at the transport level.

**Why this exists:** Spec FR-002 requires "the probe must fail on a dead address". Rather than making this a manual ritual ("manually test each probe with `nc -zv 127.0.0.1:1`"), the negative control is automatic and built into every test. It's a structural guarantee: if a probe is broken, the test *must* fail on the negative control before it ever passes. This prevents a probe that is silently always-passing or always-failing to ship.

**`ParseFlags() Flags`** — parses `-addr`, `-deadline`, `-expect-depth` and any per-game flags. Must be called by every `app.go`:

```go
flags := probe.ParseFlags()
// flags.Addr: "minecraft-java.gameplane-games.svc.cluster.local:25565"
// flags.Deadline: 4 * time.Minute (overall deadline; probe retries within this)
// flags.Expect: probe.Joined (expected depth)
```

**`Main(Flags, RunFunc)`** — never returns; runs `RunFunc(ctx)`, asserts it reached exactly `Expect` depth, and exits 0 only if both succeed. Exits 1 on any other outcome:

```go
Main(flags, func(ctx context.Context) (Depth, error) {
    // app.go implementation: dial, probe, measure depth, return (Joined, nil) or (Partial, nil) or (Query, nil)
})
```

**`Retry(ctx, what, attempt, fn)`** — calls `fn` until success, ctx expires, or `fn` returns `ErrFatal`. Logs every failed attempt. Built into the probe harness for per-game use:

```go
err := probe.Retry(ctx, "minecraft login", 30*time.Second, func(ctx context.Context) error {
    // attempt a login, return nil on success or a retryable error
})
```

### Test-side interface (`gameprobe_job.go`)

**`GameProbe` struct** — describes one probe run:

```go
type GameProbe struct {
    GameNS      string                 // namespace holding the GameServer
    GSName      string                 // GameServer name (its Service is dialled)
    Game        string                 // module dir name; selects the /probe/<Game> binary
    Port        int                    // game port (e.g. 25565 for Minecraft)
    Deadline    time.Duration          // total time allowed for the probe
    ExpectDepth joindepth.JoinDepth    // JOINED | PARTIAL | QUERY
    ExpectFail  bool                   // if set, probe must NOT reach ExpectDepth; Job invoked with -expect-fail
    Args        []string               // extra per-game flags, e.g. []string{"-user", "bot"}
}
```

**`ProbeResult` struct** — holds both the exit code and the parsed VERDICT line from a probe run:

```go
type ProbeResult struct {
    ExitCode int
    Verdict  *joindepth.ProbeVerdict
}
```

**`Env.RunGameProbe(t, GameProbe) *ProbeResult`** — creates a one-shot Job in the `default` namespace, waits for it to finish or timeout, and returns a `ProbeResult` with the exit code and parsed VERDICT line. Fails the test if the probe didn't exit 0 (on positive control) or if the negative control's assertions fail. The Job dials the game Service at `<GSName>.<GameNS>.svc.cluster.local:<Port>`.

### Per-game implementation (`app.go`)

Each `internal/<game>/app.go` is a tiny `main()` that:

1. Calls `probe.ParseFlags()` to get the server address and deadline.
2. Implements a callback function matching `func(context.Context) (probe.Depth, error)`.
3. Calls `probe.Main(flags, callback)` and never returns.

The callback dials the server, speaks the real game protocol (or query protocol if that's all that's possible), measures the join depth, and returns `(Joined, nil)`, `(Partial, nil)`, or `(Query, nil)`. If the server is misconfigured, return `(Query, probe.ErrFatal)` to skip retries.

Example shape (Minecraft):

```go
package main

import (
    "context"
    "github.com/ValgulNecron/gameplane/test/e2e/internal/probe"
    "github.com/ValgulNecron/gameplane/test/e2e/internal/minecraft-java/minecraftproto"
)

func main() {
    flags := probe.ParseFlags()
    probe.Main(flags, func(ctx context.Context) (probe.Depth, error) {
        conn, err := net.DialContext(ctx, "tcp", flags.Addr)
        if err != nil {
            return probe.Query, err
        }
        defer conn.Close()
        
        // Measure depth via real protocol
        depth, err := protocol.MeasureDepth(ctx, conn)
        return depth, err
    })
}
```

## Key invariants

1. **Depth is a measured outcome, not a planning input.** The `ExpectDepth` in `GameProbe` is not a guess or a target — it is the *exact depth the real server reaches*, measured via a previous probe run against a known-good server. If a game's depth shifts (credential gate moves, protocol access lost), the test must fail to alert the maintainer that something changed.

2. **Probe binaries import stdlib only.** The Dockerfile builds with `GOWORK=off` against `test/e2e/go.mod`. Any import of `k8s.io/*`, `github.com/ValgulNecron/gameplane/operator`, or external modules not in `test/e2e/go.mod` will compile fine locally and fail silently at docker-build time. Shared protocol families and the `probe` package itself live in `test/e2e/internal/` (OK); everything else must be stdlib.

3. **The probe is the single source of truth for join depth.** A game's `spec.md` documents the depth and cites the protocol reference (e.g., "Minecraft protocol § Login, § Encryption Request"). Tests read `ExpectDepth` from `spec.md`; `spec.md` is *not* a guess but a summary of what the probe actually measured against a reference server.

4. **Exact-depth assertion prevents silent regressions.** If a `PARTIAL` game starts JOINED (e.g., the auth gate code path changed), `probe.Main` will exit 1 because `Joined != Partial`. If it drops to `QUERY`, that also exits 1. This is intentional: the test *must* fail so we notice.

5. **Path A and Path B are independent.** Per-game `app.go` files share no code with `agent/internal/rcon/`, `api/internal/ws/`, or any Gameplane packages. This independence is the entire point — if a per-game client can reach a depth but the agent can't, that's a sign the agent's protocol layer is broken, not the game.

6. **Retry loop is in the probe, not the test.** A game server accepts TCP well before it accepts a login (world generation takes time). The probe has its own deadline-bounded retry loop; `RunGameProbe` doesn't retry the Job, just waits once for a terminal outcome. This keeps the Job a one-shot pass/fail.

7. **The probe runs in the `default` namespace, not `gameplane-games`.** The `gameplane-games` namespace carries a `NetworkPolicy` with `podSelector: {}` and default-deny-egress (only DNS allowed out). Running the probe there would block all game-port egress. Running in `default` (where network policy is unrestricted) mirrors how a real player reaches the game: from outside the games namespace. The game's own `allow-kubelet-probes` policy admits ingress from any RFC1918 pod IP, so this works.

## Dependencies

**Internal to `test/e2e/internal/`:**
- `probe` — shared harness and Depth type
- `protocol/<family>/` — shared protocol implementations (Source A2S, Steam query, LiteNetLib, etc.)

**External:**
- Stdlib only: `context`, `encoding/binary`, `fmt`, `io`, `log`, `net`, `os`, `strconv`, `strings`, `time`, and protocol-specific deps (e.g. `encoding/json` for Minecraft status).
- Go 1.25+ (same as the main repo).

No external modules in the probe image. If a game needs a special library, copy the implementation into `internal/protocol/<family>/` or `internal/<game>/`.

## Security considerations

1. **The probe runs unprivileged.** The Job sets:
   - `runAsNonRoot: true`, `runAsUser: 65532` (nonroot)
   - `readOnlyRootFilesystem: true`
   - `capabilities.drop: ["ALL"]`
   - `allowPrivilegeEscalation: false`
   - `seccompProfile: RuntimeDefault`

2. **No credentials in argv.** Per-game `Args` (e.g., `-user bot`) must never contain passwords or tokens. If a server requires authentication CI cannot mint (Steam auth, EOS PlayFab), that's a `PARTIAL` depth, and the `spec.md` must document the exact packet/step where the gate occurs.

3. **Runs from outside the games namespace.** As noted above, the `default` namespace has no egress NetworkPolicy, but the probe exercises the same network path a real player uses. The game's `allow-kubelet-probes` policy admits ingress, so the probe is a legitimate probe, not an anomaly.

4. **Protocol implementations are read-only.** Shared protocol families in `protocol/<family>/` are observational — they parse packets, measure state, and report depth. They do not mutate shared state, do not log at the application level (only debug-level when tracing a protocol), and do not attempt to modify server state. This is a read-only probe, not a fuzzer or stress tester.

## Testing & coverage

### Per-game protocol packages

Each `internal/protocol/<family>/` carries untagged unit tests that run on every `make test-go`:

- **`TestMeasureDepth_<game>`** — exercises the protocol against pre-recorded server responses or a mock that simulates the exact packets a real server sends.
- **`TestParsePackets`** — validates packet parsing on edge cases (truncated, malformed, out-of-order packets).
- Protocol-family specs live in `internal/protocol/<family>/spec.md` and cite the external protocol reference (Minecraft protocol wiki, Source engine A2S docs, etc.).

### E2E test registration

Each game's e2e test (`TestGameServer_<Game>Bot_<Depth>`) is registered in `test/e2e/buckets.sh`:

- **Fast set** (`bot-fast` bucket) — runs in the `e2e-game-bot` CI job on every PR (amd64 only):
  - `TestGameServer_MinecraftJavaBot_Joined`
  - `TestGameServer_TerrariaBot_Joined`
  - `TestGameServer_GarrysModBot_Query`

- **Heavy set** (`bot-heavy` bucket) — **deliberately never runs in CI** — only on maintainer hand-run with `GAMEPLANE_E2E_GAMES=all`:
  - All other games. Reserved for `GAMEPLANE_E2E_REUSE_CLUSTER=1 GAMEPLANE_E2E_CONTEXT=… GAMEPLANE_E2E_GAMES=all make test-e2e-keep`.

The `buckets.sh verify` step fails CI if any test is unbucketed or double-bucketed, so tests cannot be silently dropped.

### Per-game depth table

| Module | Transport | Port | Set | Probe | Depth | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| minecraft-java | TCP | 25565 | Fast | JOINED protocol | JOINED | Protocol client implemented; CI-verified (PR #194) |

| satisfactory | HTTPS | 7777 | Heavy | documented API | QUERY | Protocol client implemented; server listens on HTTPS documented API (no open-world query protocol) |

The depth column is filled in *only when a client actually measures it* — not before. All 16 game modules now have implemented protocol clients. Depths recorded here are exact measurements from real servers, not guesses or expectations.

### Probe verification: a lesson hard-won

A probe that cannot fail is worse than no test, because it is believed. Every per-game probe is therefore verified two ways: it must **fail** against an address where nothing is listening, and it must **pass** against a real listener. Passing only the first is not enough — a probe that sends an invented packet and requires a reply satisfies it while being permanently red against a real server, which is exactly what the first Factorio client did. UDP `Dial` proves nothing on its own: it completes no handshake and succeeds even against a dead address.

Every probe must establish connection semantics (TCP three-way, UDP state exchange, a request-response pair) before measuring depth. Invented packets don't suffice — the probe's response must come from a real listener, not the probe's own assumptions. Only when a probe has been verified to both fail against a dead address and pass against a known-good server can its depth measurement be trusted and recorded in this table.

### Path A implementation status

Path A exercises the module's control channel after Path B proves the server is running. Implementation status per game:

| Game | Control Channel | Path A Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| minecraft-java | RCON (protocol: source) | IMPLEMENTED | Runs the `broadcast` action with a unique per-run message, tails logs to confirm the message appears |
| terraria | stdin/PTY (protocol: none, consoleMode: pty) | IMPLEMENTED | Runs the `broadcast` action with a unique per-run message, tails logs to confirm the message appears |
| garrys-mod | none (protocol: none, no PTY) | SKIPPED | Template declares no control channel; no Path A test |
| all others | — | NOT YET IMPLEMENTED | Path A will be implemented as games are added to the fast set |

## Why the fast set is small

Four games cover the essential depth variety:

- **minecraft-java (TCP, Java):** traditional login state machine, tests *JOINED* via Encryption Request rejection (offline-mode override) or Login Success.
- **terraria (TCP, .NET):** different TCP framing (message length prefixes), tests *JOINED* via the initial handshake and player ID assignment.
- **factorio (TCP, Lua):** hand-rolled TCP accept probe and *QUERY* depth (no headless join possible — Factorio uses in-game UI for multiplayer, no headless auth). Demonstrates that UDP diagnostics can deceive: the server exposes no UDP query surface despite listening on its game port.
- **garrys-mod (UDP, Source engine):** shared Source family with cs2, exercises A2S query protocol.

These four, plus their shared protocol families, give coverage: TCP state machines, UDP queries, TCP-only (non-protocol) probes, and the two depth tiers most games hit (JOINED or QUERY). Adding Valheim, Palworld, 7-days-to-die, and Rust would triple CI boot time with no new protocol variety.

## Why the heavy set never runs in CI

Heavy games are not a testing gap — they are a provisioning constraint:

- **Disk:** GitHub-hosted runners have ~14 GB usable disk after the OS, Docker images, and runner overhead. CS2 declares a 60Gi PVC, 7-days-to-die 55Gi across two, DayZ 40Gi, ARK 30Gi. Even one of these exhausts the node.
- **Throughput:** Seven games (CS2, 7DTD, DayZ, ARK, Palworld, Valheim, Rust) run multi-GB SteamCMD or Proton downloads on first boot. CI runners (especially shared GitHub-hosted) have inconsistent upload/download throughput; a 20GB download can take 10+ minutes or fail partway.
- **Duration:** Combining boot time (10–30 min per heavy game) and download throughput means a single CI job would timeout even if disk were not exhausted.

**This is a standing decision, not temporary.** Heavy games' protocol packages and unit tests still ship and still run in `make test-go` on every PR — it is only the real-image boot that is maintainer-initiated. The command:

```bash
GAMEPLANE_E2E_REUSE_CLUSTER=1 GAMEPLANE_E2E_CONTEXT=<kubelab|prod> GAMEPLANE_E2E_GAME_BOT=1 GAMEPLANE_E2E_GAMES=all make test-e2e-keep
```

runs all 16 games against a pre-existing cluster (e.g., the `kubelab` remote k3s). No CI job ever executes `bot-heavy` or sets `GAMEPLANE_E2E_GAMES` to `all` or `heavy`.

## Shared protocol families

Known families (each with its own `internal/protocol/<family>/` dir, spec, and unit tests):

- **A2S / Source A2S query (`protocol/a2s`):** `A2S_GETCHALLENGE` + `A2S_INFO` connectionless query protocol, verified against Valve's specification. Used by cs2, garrys-mod, and others. Returns player count, server name, map, game version. Implementation is confirmed correct and determines QUERY depth.
- **Source protocol (`protocol/source`):** Challenge and Connect handshake for login-phase connectivity. The challenge exchange (A2S_GETCHALLENGE → S2C_CHALLENGE) is CONFIRMED against a real Garry's Mod server (PR #197, 2026-07-24). The server's ability to parse C2S_CONNECT and reply with a structured rejection is CONFIRMED. The rejection-handling logic now correctly identifies response type 0x39 as a rejection. Packet layout remains unverified (server rejected before validating fields beyond the header). Protocol version is the measured next blocker. Currently used diagnostically for evidence; does not determine depth until the version constant is corrected and re-measured.
- **Steam A2S (query-only):** Same as above; some servers support both query and a login state.
- **LiteNetLib (Unity):** Connection-oriented UDP with per-message reliability flags, used by 7-days-to-die and possibly v-rising.
- **Minecraft protocol:** Handshaking, Status (Server List Ping), Login states. Shared across Java and potential .NET Bedrock ports.
- **Terraria protocol:** TCP message frames with length prefixes; per-player handshake and state.

Per-game `protocol/` dirs hold only game-specific deviations: Minecraft protocol version pinning (1.20.1, 1.21, etc.), Terraria mod-specific packet IDs, ARK's custom A2S extensions, etc.
