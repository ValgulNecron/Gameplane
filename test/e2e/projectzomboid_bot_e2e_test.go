// TestGameServer_ProjectZomboidBot_Query boots a REAL Project Zomboid server
// (sknnr/zomboid-dedicated-server:v1.1.1) through the operator, waits for it to reach Running,
// then runs a minimal UDP probe inside the cluster to measure the join depth.
//
// Project Zomboid is part of the HEAVY SET because its image is large (requires multi-GB download
// of Proton layers + game assets) and boots slowly (10+ minutes on first run for world generation).
// It never runs in CI; only on maintainer hand-run with GAMEPLANE_E2E_GAMES=all.
//
// The test is deliberately NOT t.Parallel(): concurrent real-game boots OOM-starve a
// single kind node.
//
// DEPTH EXPECTATION: This test expects QUERY depth, which is proven by the server's response
// to a UDP handshake on port 16261. The probe sends a minimal packet and waits for the server
// to respond, confirming it is alive and accepting UDP connections. A full join (PARTIAL or JOINED)
// requires understanding Project Zomboid's undocumented wire protocol, which this probe does not
// yet implement.
//
// Future iterations can escalate to PARTIAL or JOINED once the protocol is reverse-engineered
// from captured server responses (which are logged as hex dumps in the CI job logs).
