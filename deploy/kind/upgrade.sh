# Ephemeral kind cluster seeded with the LAST PUBLISHED RELEASE, for the
# upgrade e2e test.
#
# Why this exists separately from e2e.sh: that script installs the
# working-tree chart with locally-built gameplane-test/* images, which is the
# right thing for every other bucket and exactly the wrong thing here. The
# upgrade test has to start from the artifacts a real user actually installed
# — the published chart, pulling the published GHCR images — and then upgrade
# to the working tree. So this script only does the "install the old release"
# half; the test itself runs `helm upgrade` to the working-tree chart.
#
# Usage:
#   deploy/kind/upgrade.sh up   [cluster-name] [tag]
#   deploy/kind/upgrade.sh down [cluster-name]

# 0.2.0-beta.5 and not beta.6 — beta.6 was never published (its chart and all
# three images 404 on GHCR, though the git tag exists), so beta.5 is the last
# release a user could actually have installed before beta.7. That also makes
# this a genuine two-version jump rather than a no-op against the current tree.

    #     image at all, so leaving it on would fail the install outright.

    # Note what is NOT overridden: image.registry/image.tag. The old release
